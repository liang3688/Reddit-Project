0,post,3,uk450v,a very strang eproblem,"HEllo everyone. I need your help.

&#x200B;

FO some very strange reason, whenever i open steam, the drive where all my steam games are installed on becomes read only. the drive is new, has more then 1TB free space and is ext4. remounting to rw does not work.

&#x200B;

When i close steam, unmount the drive using disks, remount the drive / or if i just restart, the drive mounts fine with proper permissions. Until and as soon as i open steam... This makes it so that i cannot update all the games on that drive and most of them wont run.

&#x200B;

Any advice?

&#x200B;

edit: in case anyoneone asks... 5600x, rx480 8gb, 16gb ram. os runs from ssd, games on 4tb hdd. still running 21.10... too scared to go 22.04 so soon...",pop_os,1651892714.0

The games are on an internal drive which was already formatted to EXT4. Steam Play IS on. I added the drive to Steam, but I can't play anything. File integrity check gives an okay. I can see their files in the folders. But all the games say ""Install"" with a black button and next to them it says ""available for Windows"", but on the 2 or 3 games with Linux versions, it says I can play them. What's wrong?

Edit 1: Since I was able to start and play Hollow Knight, which was native, I figured it was a Steam issue as opposed to a drive issue, so I uninstalled Steam, which was the deb file from their website, and I tried installing the Steam deb on the Pop Shop, but trying to do so INSTANTLY crashed the Pop Shop.

When you're at the menu, select the old kernel and press d to make it default. This means you won't have to select it every time.

With every kernel update the current becomes old and the new becomes current. Which means if the next kernel update doesn't fix your issue, you won't have a kernel to boot to.

So make a copy of your ```/boot/efi/EFI/Pop_XXXXX``` now, as this is where the (copies of) the current and old kernel are.

Then I started noticing apps disappearing. First it was Discord, then Teams. There was another that I forget the name. It was still available in Terminal but no app icon.

Is this because I haven't upgraded to 22.04? I've seen some issues of people saying their apps are being removed or having to uninstall them after 22.04 upgrade.

UPDATE: Ended up updating to 22.04. Issues persisted. Didn't want to waste hours of time looking into the exact reason why things are slowly breaking so I did a refresh after install.

UPDATE 2: After refresh the pop shop does not open. manually ran apt update/upgrade but it still will not open. Attempted flatpak update and get the same errors as above still. So much for trying to avoid digging into issues. Considering a fresh install now, instead of trying to look at the individual issues. I really don't feel like troubleshooting an issue that popos caused and not me.

Update 3:

This is a long bit of info, so if I have time I will do a howto tomorrow. 

Short version:
* loader entry files are in ```/boot/efi/loader/entries```
* kernels are in ```/boot/efi/EFI/Pop_XXXXX```
* or you can place your kernel in any folder you make in ```/boot/efi/EFI```, e.g ```xanmod```, so copy the kernel and initramfs there
* you create a new loader entry file (see first step) by copying one of the existing ones (Pop_OS-current.conf)
* edit the title, e.g ```xandmod```
* edit the kernel location and name in the ```linux``` line (see 3rd bullet point)
* edit the ```initrd``` line (the file should be alongside the kernel)
* leave or edit the kernel options as required
* save the loader file with a different name

Now if you reboot you will see this entry to boot from in your menu (spam the spacebar after the POST screen). Select it, press ```d``` to make default.

1. PopOS uses `sytemd-boot` so all those wonderful things like the Grub Customizer don't work.
1. PopOS is based on Ubuntu so there is this general sense that things you can do with Ubuntu will work with PopOS. Not so in general. Especially regarding kernel management. So people are led astray by the differences.
1. There is no nice GUI to manage kernels after all this time.
1. Anecdotally Ubuntu Mainline looks nice but for me it failed miserably on PopOS. But it's at least useful in advising when a new Kernel is available.

* move on one browser and the terminal window to Workspace 2
* use the window switcher to switch between browser app on workspace 1 and browser app on workspace 2
* switch back to browser app on workspace 1

113,comment,1,i7mal4j,,"Probably due to firmware and software tuning for System 76 products... They have proprietary bios and I think went to the lengths of removing (in)famous Intel Management Engine chip.
Not so sure about this, only read some articles though, as those are not available in my country nor they ship outside of US but I would like to get my hands on one ;)

In my case for Dell laptop it's the other way around, even though I bought their 'developer edition' supposed-to-be Linux friendly expensive tool with UHD monitor and came with Ubuntu preinstalled. It even had Dell's official package source maintained for an year or two... But Windows runs smoothly with up to 8-9 hours.

If I don't spend few weeks in tuning it manually Linux a
is a battery hog for laptops. Linux kernel is not at all laptop friendly with all modern low power modes P-states and C-states CPU support, suspend, sleep, modern (hybrid) sleep/hibernation, proper suspend/resume, UI scaling and so on... Simply put laptop is not Linux kernel target at all... It's the server that makes it shine.

Not to mention Wayland immaturity with Nvidia etc... I have to waste time with power top, c7z, TLP, disabling hyper threading, thermald, throtled, powering off Nvidia card (if I manage at all since it's software multiplexed), ACPI issues and whatnot... Then I will have near-windows battery life...

Anyway, after installing Pop OS I was shocked how well this has been tweaked as much as it can even on non-system 76 hardware even in pure Nvidia mode. I can imagine with all those hardware tweaking on their systems how well it runs...

I'm not surprised at all... They did a great job, considering how small team they are. I always thought it's niche distro until I tried it out. Everything fell into it's place - say 90% of time saved on manual tweaking and hair pulled ;)

122,post,1,ujl53v,I think Vulkan is currently broken with my RTX card,"Lately I tried to play Ori and the will of the wisp, and the Vulkan set up took much longer than I expected, and in the game it stuttered very hard every time I approach a new area.

I've played a fair bit of Windows games in the past year including Elden Ring, and stuttered does happens, but never this hard.

Coupled with the fact that my CPU was 100% on all threads during the Vulkan set up stage, I think there's a driver issue that GPU doesn't process Vulkan so the poor CPU has to do all the work.

And just this morning, I launched CSGO with -vulkan first time in weeks, the game basically freezes when there are new things to compile. It wasn't the case before.

I haven't really do tests to confirm it, so it might all be my imagination, but does anyone has the same issue? How do I troubleshoot it? Is there a magical pakage that can potentially solve it?

244,comment,2,i7jk76x,,"Thanks for this post, I thought I was losing my mind.

After the upgrade to 22.04 and the kernel update to 5.16.19 it totally borked my system.

However it runs perfectly on 5.16.15 kernel with the 22.04 upgrade.  So after a lot of fucking around to remove the 5.16.19 kernel headers (to avoid having to use the space bar on boot every time to select the 5.16.15 kernel image) all was good and I was slowing investigation how I might move forward to the next kernel update when it was made available.

In the morning I sit down and I see a System Reboot required notification.

I'm like wtf, I check to see if I had auto updates on, No I don't.  So I decided to try and check to see what in fact was updated or why it needed a System Reboot.  I was unable to find and logs for this ... not saying there isn't any tho.

So yeah reboot and boom ZSTD Compressed data corrupt -- System Halted--

Restart and boot into the kernel options and sure enough now I see 5.17 kernel header, well just freaking great.

Select 5.16.15 and good to go.",pop_os,1651837665.0

Checked [System76's audio troubleshooting](https://support.system76.com/articles/audio/), but they haven't updated their documentation (apparently 22.04 is now using Pipewire instead of Pulse Audio). I've read in various places that the sampling bitrate can be adjusted to a range, but the locations of the config files usually don't match up with that of my system, and what config files I have found, there's no setting commensurate with what said documentation provides.  


Some other things I've done:  
1. Restart  
2. OS Refresh (oof)  
3. kill/restart pipewire

287,post,0,uj87v1,Pop!_Shop should have warnings on proprietary deb packages,"For someone that came from Windows, this is something that took me a while to understand. A lot of people on the internet bash Flatpak, so my intuition was to install everything as a deb package.

Including Steam... and my experience was not fun as a result.

I tried 3 NATIVE games, none of which worked out of the box, because of library issues.

Solution to all my issues was to install Steam as a Flatpak.

I feel like there should be a big red warning when trying to install proprietary deb packages, or just don't offer these packages as deb at all. Maybe a (?) button could be placed near deb/flatpak drop-box that explains the true advantages and disadvantages of both.",pop_os,1651787348.0

 I do think it needs to be more obvious if something is Using flatpak, or a normal deb package. I have seen way too many posts where people have issues, and several long support posts later  it comes up that they are using the flatpak, which is the core of their problem.

You can look for the error by way of

cat /etc/fstab

Ideally when you make a change to a critical system file you make a backup of it first in case you need to back out the change made.  If you don't have one, just be careful about changing fstab back to how it was before.

Edit the file using your favorite console-based text editor.  I prefer vi.  You may want to use nano.

1- From previous comments you made, I'm assuming this is not working  
`sudo apt purge ""*nvidia*""`  
`sudo apt autoremove`  
`sudo apt clean`  
`sudo apt install system76-driver-nvidia`

2- The one that worked for me and may work for you is downgrading to 470 and also downgrading the kernel.  
Check your kernel with this `uname -r`  
For me the problem tends to be due to the new kernel 5.17.xxx  
Switch kernels with  
`sudo kernelstub -v -k /boot/vmlinuz-5.16.19-76051619-generic -i /boot/initrd.img-5.16.19-76051619-generic`  

The next thing is that, for me 470.86 was the last properly working Nvidia driver.

Well it definitely is possible. There are way more machines running AMD and Intel (for which the drivers are in the kernel as well) graphics running perfectly fine on kernels that are not 5.17 than there are on 5.17.

And System76 H/W is not that bleeding edge that the benefits justify the problems.

Well, they are moving to 12th generation now  (the Oryx Pro being the first, but not yet available, as far as I can see). That's modern, but not what I'd consider ""bleeding edge"".

System76 do a really good job on both hardware and the OS. It'd just a letdown if I cannot recommend it to beginners because it gives the impression that Linux breaks regularly. Which it doesn't need to.

374,comment,1,i7h4sef,,"**SOLUTION**  
Solved it thanks to reading the link provided by /u/david279  
As they've figured out there exists no kernel modules of 5.17.5 for 470  
to keep using 470 one needs to revert back to old kernel

Check the current kernel by `uname -r`

Then switch to 5.16.19 with:
`sudo kernelstub -v -k /boot/vmlinuz-5.16.19-76051619-generic -i /boot/initrd.img-5.16.19-76051619-generic`

The weird problem I had is that even though I was on 5.16.19 and confirmed it with uname -r, **IF** the 5.17.5 kernel wasn't removed during the `sudo apt install nvidia-driver-470` process the kernel would **revert** (I don't know a better term for it) back to 5.17.5.

So if you want to use 470:
1. Change kernel to an old one
1. Remove new kernel 5.17.5
1. Install nvidia driver and be happy

I did a fresh install of 22.04 (twice, but I'll get to that) and for some reason when I use sudo reboot or the restart button it acts like it's shutting down and then goes to ""No Signal"" on my monitor and never reboots. I hear it crunching away, but I've let it sit for an hour with nothing ever happening. Using a straight up shutdown command works so I set up wake-on-LAN to get around the issue, but I was curious as to what could cause it to hang on restart? The screen switches to ""No Signal"" so I can't see what it might say. I ran 

    journalctl -b-1 | grep systemd 

and [here is the output](https://pastebin.com/UpqRpF9G). The only failure I see there is for encryption, maybe. 

I say I did two fresh installs because the hanging restart broke two different hardware installations the first two times it happened. Both had the same issue with restarting. That's when I switched to WOL instead of restarts. If anyone has any input it would be appreciated. Using WOL is super easy, barely and inconvenience, so I don't mind.

In use 3 monitors, 2 horizontal and one vertical. Pop loves to launch apps that have their title bar off screen so I can't minimize, maximize or  close. 
Wayland will probably fix this so i guess my first would be Wayland by default but that's probably on the way in the next release or two. 

-  'show maximize' in the app title bar on by default. 
I'm still on 21.10 but when I make new users, I have to use Gnome Tweaks to show the maximize button. Its a minor grievance but it can be frustrating.

- show asterisks when typing passwords on the terminal by default. 
Elementary OS have been doing this for a while and I far prefer it. You can enable it by changing some config file, but having it on by default or being able to toggle it in settings/ preferences would be super cool.

- Use Papirus icons by default like how Manjaro does. 
Papirus is excellent since it has the most icons and almost every app out there has a Papirus icon. The default Pop! Icons just aren't as good.  

Another thing I'd like is if they included MenuLibre as a default app. It allows you to change the name and icon or applications as they appear in Pop. While you can do this by editing the .desktop in nano or whatever, having a GUI to do this is far more beginner friendly.

The basis of the book, retelling a bunch of stories about bad project management, is that number of man hours spent on a project is not a valid metric for how much progress has been made towards completing it.

Bad managers think that adding more people to a project will make it finish faster, but the reality is that after a certain point, more people causes more stalls in development, and increases the amount of communication required. And even despite that, most of the progress is made by a select few who know the most about the project. Even in that select few, most work is accomplished by a single person.

So you will often here developers mention that it's much easier to start a new project from scratch than to adapt something written by someone else with decades of baggage. We are speaking about a desktop environment that's written in a 50 year old programming language that nobody in their right mind would use today. Even GNOME is rewriting some of their core applications from scratch instead of adapting them for GTK4.

Think about how much human hours have already been spent on GNOME. System76 has already invested a lot of effort into GNOME. I see the writing on the wall when I look at the source code.

This argument is a slippery slope in general. You could use the same argument to state that there is no point in investing in the Linux desktop because the ""industry"" already consolidated around Windows.

The argument about Canonical misses one key fact. They laid off their desktop engineers because their entire profit model is based around server and IoT. Unity/Mir was being funded for the purpose of becoming a successful mobile platform that could compete with Android. Naturally, that never materialized and they had to lay off everyone as a result to focus on their only proven profit centers.

455,post,68,uj0up1,Can unstable kernel updates be made optional?,"Hi,

I love what Pop\_OS! is doing in the way of integrating Nvidia, being a ""batteries included"" distribution for scientific users, and the DE (tiling is just mandatory for my workflow).

However, Pop\_OS! has a huge drawback for me as an academic user: I cannot recommend it to students, post-docs, and colleagues, because it tends to break every now and then due to kernel and Nvidia driver updates.

In the past, the Nvidia driver upgrades were pushed aggressively and even systems whose GPUs were not supported by the new driver (e.g., from 470 to 510) were updated to the new driver and stopped working. Sometime during 21.10 this was (finally) changed and we can now install legacy drivers (e.g. 390, or 470) and avoid systems breaking because of a regular update.

While I understand (and welcome) that Pop\_OS! has more modern kernels than other distributions, I'd say we need some way to pin a kernel - if stability is required.

Today my laptop stopped working properly due to a kernel upgrade (5.16 to 5.17) which broke suspend, and looking around here, I'm not alone. The system in question worked flawlessly with the old kernel, but I cannot use it with the new one.

So I'd say we need a way to pin the kernel (possibly this should be the default, since Pop\_OS! seems to be quite popular with beginners), in order to avoid this from happening.

Or we need a better testing regime before these updates are pushed out. These problems occur on System76 devices, so it's not a niche, or Walmart system problem. In my case they occur on Linux certified professional hardware (not System76, but HP).

As I said, I love what Pop\_OS! is doing on many fronts, but I would argue that pushing untested, breaking updates (in the same mechanism as security updates), means it is not an option for what seems to be the main target audience (science, research, developers) on a production system.

Ideas?

Pinning the kernel seems to be a difficult thing to do, since it's all baked into the dependencies of the main system, which always will pull in the most recent linux-image package.

So for the time being I'll be back to recommending Ubuntu or Linux Mint again.

* have one default option of `linux-system76` which has an up-to-date kernel at time of the release of the LTS, ideally an LTS kernel, which get's security updates. Potentially this could be in-line with the signed Ubuntu kernel, which would mean that secure-boot would work on these installations as well (two birds, one stone?).
* have an optional package `linux-system76-edge` which replaces `linux-system76` and pulls in the bleeding edge kernel we now have.

Would that be an option that would be interesting to the users? Could be the best of both worlds.

Scenario: close lid on laptop, put in bag, laptop not suspended, no cooling, laptop overheating. Theoretically the laptops thermal controls should kick in and shut it down, but with a broken kernel that doesn't always work.

2. aimed at professional users, not at tinkerers. Some of (1) applies and the creative, research, developer types all of System76's marketing aims at, simply can't be arsed to troubleshoot a kernel every few weeks - even if, like me, they are perfectly capable to do so.

I asked the main devs exactly that and was told that that is not the case. And, as evidence shows these upgrades break just as often on System76 hardware.

I don't complain if an update breaks a students system, because they bought the cheapest laptop they could get their hands on. Often Ubuntu won't run on those as well.

But in my case, all the h/w is:

1. Linux certified
2. Runs perfectly fine in the release version of Pop\_OS! and just breaks because the upgrades are not fully implemented and tested.

It's only minor things and after 30 years of working with and on Linux, i'm not too fussed, and all the problems that the new kernel has brought have already been fixed on my machines.

The H/W on System76 rigs is not that bleeding edge. I'd say it's rather conservative. As a professional system should be. So I'd question the need for the aggressive update strategy.

And if you follow the ""keep the kernel bleeding edge"" strategy, then any new kernel needs to be integrated into a system very carefully (module parameters may change, suspend scripts need adjusting, schedulers need to be updated, ...). I've done that a couple of times on our own distribution back in the day.

That System76 can do that is demonstrated by the near-perfection they deliver on the release-ISO. Everything works smoothly out of the box for those. At least that's my really positive experience with them.

But then the first kernel updates arrive and are integrated rather half-baked, breaking small things - or sometimes large ones. Often with issues that are known on the kernel list and have known fixes, but these fixes are not implemented.

I know that because I have on several occasions posted the solution to the issues here, before Pop\_OS! devs did.

I also know the solution(s) to the current issues. But that means that Pop\_OS!'s QA could do a better job before kernel updates are rolled out.

&#x200B;

I recently migrated to Pop OS on my secondary machine which I primarily use for light gaming. I love the experience and upgraded to 22.04 without a fuss at all. 

&#x200B;

I do have an issue though that I want to resolve - and it's more of a creature comfort rather than a deal-breaker and it is this: 

&#x200B;

Steam installs Windows games via Proton and it all works like a charm, however, adding a desktop shortcut through Steam does absolutely nothing either on the actual Desktop, or at \~/.local/share/applications   ... ergo, I am in need of opening up Steam, navigating to the title I want to launch and then launching it - creating a few extra steps. 

&#x200B;

I don't mind running Steam in the background, but other solution such as Lutris have been great at adding Desktop shortcuts creating a very nice seamless experience, Steam does not - regardless of whether it is a native Linux game, or a Windows port via Proton.

&#x200B;

Iteration on a new foundation. ""bad copy"" I think undersells the hard work being done to bring this new DE to light and it's extremely common to make the ""new"" thing equal to the ""old"" thing on a better foundation.

755,post,4,ui8vum,New to Pop OS and Linux in general. I have lost all sound.,"I am fairly new to Linux so I apologize if I am not very knowledgeable with certain aspects of the OS.

I tried out my first Linux distro a few months ago, with Linux Mint, and all was well for awhile. But suddenly out of nowhere I lost all sound. I am talking no sound from anything. Nothing from the speakers on the LG CX tv, nothing from any bluetooth or plugged in headphones, nothing. I tried so many troubleshoots online to no avail. I even tried a fresh install with the same issue right out of the gate.

So now I figured maybe it was an issue with that distro. Figured I would give Pop OS a try as it sounded better for my needs anyway. At first I had sound, for maybe 5 minutes, and then poof. Nothing. Again. Why?

I tried everything from the support page of System76, and nothing worked. I have tried numerous ""fixes"" from online with no luck. I am on a i9 10850k, RTX 3080. If I open alsamixer, it defaults to the HDA Intel PCH and if I switch to the HDA NVidia it's all zeros. Here are some screens. I am at a loss, maybe someone has something I haven't tried though? Thank you.

I'm currently running 20.04 and it works perfectly. I haven't customized my system much so most of the things in my system are in the default states. But as I seen in the subreddit the 3rd party PPAs and gnome extensions can get the installation process down. I've have installed few from both. I'm not a Linux expert so can someone guide me through how to disable/remove those PPAs and gnome extensions and other practices to make the installation process a success. Finally I need to know how to re-activate those PPAs and extensions again after a successful install. I have put screenshots of both lists. Thanks in advance!

I use a firewire audio interface (Focusrite Saffire PRO40) and in 20.10 I was using Jack to manage audio (and of course Pulse). Now, post upgrade, my audio doesn't work at all. I uninstalled QjackCtl in case that was conflicting with pipewire, but I assume there is some setup I have to do to get pipewire and the now included Jack to work with my interface. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks!

EDIT: I should mention that my interface or Jack does not show up in the available output devices in the PopOS settings.

EDIT AGAIN: I checked and Linux sees the audio interface, audio works through the headphone and line out ports native to my mobo, and the issue really only seems to be telling PopOS to send audio to the firewire interface. I've seen rumblings that Ubunto 22.04 dropped support for firewire audio interfaces, if that's true it sounds like I'm screwed",pop_os,1651670503.0

""Copy to ..."" and ""Move to ..."" are working fine btw.

I have had [https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4839/clipboard-history/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4839/clipboard-history/) installed but uninstalled it to check if this was part of the issue, but that didn't do anything.

Also ""ksnip"" which I use to take screenshots doesn't copy the image to the clipboard anymore.

In any event, 22.10 should be out in October, and by then you'll be a few months without updates on 21.10, and probably you won't be able to upgrade as the servers will be taken down for such an unsupported version.

Your best bet, since you're installing from scratch, is to make 22.04 work. It is obvious (to me), you need a good installation medium, and that's the only thing holding you back. 

So, download 22.04, verify its SHA, use ventoy and once you copy the ISO on it (ventoy is unlike any other ""flashing"" tool), confirm the sha of the ISO on the USB.

Wouldn't have changed anything. No critical blockers remained from issue reports from the beta, and all upgrade tests passed successfully, so there was no reason to delay the release.

As usual, there were a handful of debian package conflicts found from failed upgrade logs and reports here on Reddit. Those required updating and fixing some packages, or adding them to the auto-remove list in the upgrade daemon.

Let's start with their kernel.  It's sporadically updated at best.  Have they managed to put out a 5.17.x kernel yet? If not, why haven't they at least put out the latest 5.16.x revision?  In addition at some point Pop's own kernel wasn't even stable on my wife's Lemur Pro sometime during 21.10.  I ended p switching her to Xanmod to make her system useable.  Oh and have you ever tried to use a non-Pop! approved kernel in Pop! OS?  It's a total and complete pain in the ass due to their idiotic and overly simplistic use of Kernelstub.

Let's talk about their desktop endeavors.  Their whole approach to the desktop is a mess.  Their UX decisions are inconsistent and their default behaviors are quizzical.  It all started off nice and great with the tiling functionality, but everything since then has provided questionable value and seems half baked at best.  Despite this System 76 is investing tons of time and effort into developing their own desktop environment.  Personally I am predicting an epic fail that'll make Canonical's Unity look like a stunning success in comparison.

Let's talk about their reluctance to move to Wayland.  Wayland is the future. The only part of XOrg that is even being remotely maintained is XWayland at this point.  Shipping a Linux distro in 2022 that uses XOrg by default is a stunning slap in the face to the community's efforts to modernize the Linux desktop.  It's an embarrassment and an egregious failure.  And don't give me that Nvidia hardware crap.  Perhaps System 76 should stop shipping proprietary Nvidia GPUs in most of their devices and switch over to more open AMD GPUs.  But no because they refuse to source more FOSS friendly hardware for their laptop division, everybody gets to suffer.  Lovely.

Let's talk about their botched Pipewire rollout with 22.04.  In 21.10 I had a perfect pipewire setup using a third party PPA.  Before the upgrade to 22.04, I removed that PPA and reverted back to Pulse and then did the upgrade.  Pop's native Pipewire implementation is inconsistent and doesn't work as expected.  I assume this is likely because it was supplied by Canonical who themselves has chosen not to turn it on by default in their own distribution and all System 76 did was enable it in theirs.  Don't believe Pipewire in 22.04 is botched?  Read the threads in this subreddit.

Let's talk about their package repos.  Dependency problems seem to creep up very often in the Pop! repos.  See LTT's experience with Pop for the most public example of this problem to date.  I have myself seen similar situations happen a couple times since then (though arguably with a much better resolution than the aforementioned LTT example).

A lot of these problems seem to stem from a lacking attention to detail on the System 76 side, which is likely the result of them biting off way more than they can chew.  Stop trying to do all the things people.  Pick a few and do them well.  I'm also willing to bet a lot of these problems (the repo ones in particular) are also the result of Pop! not being an actual distribution of it's own but instead being a derivative of a derivative of Debian.

The combination of all of these factors finally convinced me to move on after over two years with Pop!  It was a decent ride for the first couple releases, but things have gotten increasingly painful as of late.

There is a thorough review process which has QA performing regression tests on new kernels daily. A kernel is not released until all regression tests have passed. That's not sporadic. It's just practical due diligence. The scheduler service tweaking latencies and RT preempt also effectively defeats the purpose of Xanmod on Pop.

> Let's talk about their desktop endeavors. Their whole approach to the desktop is a mess. Their UX decisions are inconsistent and their default behaviors are quizzical.

They're quite consistent in what they're striving for. It can't be helped that the current desktop suffers from the whims of upstream decisions in GNOME. That's part of the reason why COSMIC is being written from scratch. There's very limited control over tweaking GNOME.

> Let's talk about their reluctance to move to Wayland. 

GNOME Wayland is full of critical bugs and NVIDIA support is simply not functional at all. Even Ubuntu cancelled the Wayland update for NVIDIA systems, and there's a lot of issue reports for Wayland bugs that are only resolvable by instructing users how to return to X11 by editing configs in the system. Is that the experience you want people to have?

> Let's talk about their botched Pipewire rollout with 22.04.  In 21.10 I had a perfect pipewire setup using a third party PPA.

This would make it your fault. There's nothing I can do about people adding PPAs to their system and thereby resulting in breaking the dependency resolution. PPAs make apt dependency resolution very flaky.

> Let's talk about their package repos. Dependency problems seem to creep up very often in the Pop! repos.

As a person who maintains it I'm confused as to what you mean by that. The LTT issue is overblown and it was caused by a reliance on the Launchpad service that we stopped using in 21.10. There's a very thorough QA process for uploading packages. QA wouldn't be able to test packages if there were conflicts.

> A lot of these problems seem to stem from a lacking attention to detail on the System 76 side

Bonus points to this guy for wearing a ""LINUS SHOULD HAVE WATCHED"" tee, as if he missed the point of that vid.

It's clear that the downloadable ISO on their website isn't *truly* meant for end users, and its primary purpose is to test drive the system before it's deployed to their hardware (and I get it, they are a system integrator first and foremost). For one, they replaced the stable Pop_Os version with the beta and there is no way to get the old ISO without surfing random Reddit threads for a direct link. For two, [it has a couple of liveUSB-](https://github.com/pop-os/pop/issues/1058)related issues on some hardware that have been open for a couple of years at this point when they could have easily been fixed, as evident by existing fixes in the links.

I myself had issues with the liveUSB which only got fixed after I stopped trying to boot directly from UEFI and changed the boot order instead. I haven't had this issue on *any* other distro. But once I installed 22.04 the overall experience has been... mixed. I absolutely love the design, but the system has been incredibly unstable for me, with windows just... randomly freezing. I know it's GNOME with extensions, but I haven't had these issues on other distros. Or perhaps it's their new scheduler messing things up.

>is likely the result of them biting off way more than they can chew

I think that's the crux of the issue. But I believe that their end goal is to ultimately distance themselves from the wider ""Linux"" community and to become their own thing, so as to create a devoted and heavily invested group of rabid fanboys (which is already a thing for Pop_Os, moreso than for many other distros). Their target audience isn't ""I've resurrected my Acer Aspire lappy with the new Pop_Os distro!"". Their target audience is ""Linux? I'm rocketing off in Pop_Os! on my Lemur Pro, *sweaty.*"" And there is nothing wrong with that.

I do think that their decision to create a new DE is puzzling even if the above is their end goal. KDE and Gnome are the two biggest and most feature-rich DEs with *monstrous* dev teams and communities, and *they still can't bring up the polish/UX/feature support level on par with, say, Windows 11. If making a new DE in Rust means doing *everything*, including the window manager, I struggle to imagine how they could accomplish this in a reasonable timeframe. But I do hope I'm wrong and System76 can manage to do it.

Also call me when Gnome figures out what to do with VRR under Wayland, where they've been stalling for the past two years in analysis paralysis since 2020.

Except the pesky detail in which System 76's 15.5.x kernel was unstable on a Lemur Pro 9 and two other non-System 76 branded pieces of Ryzen hardware I used it on.  Stability matters.  Disappointing to see you gloss over the most important detail.  Xanmod 5.15.x was stable. System 76 5.15.x was not.  Simple as that.

> They're quite consistent in what they're striving for. It can't be helped that the current desktop suffers from the whims of upstream decisions in GNOME. That's part of the reason why COSMIC is being written from scratch. There's very limited control over tweaking GNOME.

Having recently switched all three of my and my wife daily driver machines over to Fedora 36, I have recently spent a lot of time with Gnome's actual vision of how a desktop should work and you know what? It's actually pretty damn solid.  There is a high degree of consistency in how things work. look and function.  I don't agree with all of it, but a handful of extensions allow me to get past those disagreements.

In addition the fact that System 76 thinks they can pop out an adequate replacement for Gnome / KDE / Insert any other DE here with just a years worth of work is honestly laughable.  It reminds me very much of when Canonical decided to unleash Unity upon their user base way back when.  It took them years to realize that it was a mistake.  I wonder how long it will take System 76 to realize it.  Good luck on that journey.

> GNOME Wayland is full of critical bugs and NVIDIA support is simply not functional at all. Even Ubuntu cancelled the Wayland update for NVIDIA systems, and there's a lot of issue reports for Wayland bugs that are only resolvable by instructing users how to return to X11 by editing configs in the system. Is that the experience you want people to have?

For starters Gnome Wayland works just fine on Intel and AMD GPUs.  I know because I'm daily driving it on all of that hardware right now and it's been spectacular.  Bad mouthing Gnome's Wayland support isn't going to score you any points here my friend.

In addition as I understand it (and this may be wrong as I am committed to not providing any financial support to Nvidia so I haven't used their hardware in a very long time), Nvidia on Wayland works reasonably well (finally after years of Nvidia dragging their feet).  What doesn't work well is hybrid Intel / Nvidia graphic scenarios, which System 76 deals a lot in.

Nvidia has single-handedly held back the Linux desktop for well over a decade now by refusing to adopt open standards, assist in developing open drivers for their hardware and generally thumbing their nose at anybody who dares to contradict them in any way, shape or form.  The entire Linux community could do itself a real favor by simply refusing to enrich Nvidia for their endless stream of half ass efforts when it comes to Linux support as those efforts are actually making Linux on the desktop worse rather than better by effectively forcing Linux distros like Pop to ship XOrg as the default in a day and age in which XOrg isn't being maintained in any salient way outside of XWayland.

You are you doing your users an active disservice by continuing to source, ship and bend over backwards to support Nvidia hardware.  Your hardware customers suffer because of it and your distro customers suffer because of it.

I can only hope that in time, you all will adopt a more progressive position after you come to the realization that Nvidia is neither your users nor your friend.

> This would make it your fault. There's nothing I can do about people adding PPAs to their system and thereby resulting in breaking the dependency resolution. PPAs make apt dependency resolution very flaky.

Love the victim blaming.  Good job burying it deep enough where most people won't read it. My use of the Pipewire PPA had fuck all to do with my problems as there are mountains of threads here in which users who weren't using that PPA and also upgraded, experienced very similar problems.  Meanwhile back on Fedora 36, which is also shipping Pipewire by default, shit has been working quite well.

> As a person who maintains it I'm confused as to what you mean by that. The LTT issue is overblown and it was caused by a reliance on the Launchpad service that we stopped using in 21.10. There's a very thorough QA process for uploading packages. QA wouldn't be able to test packages if there were conflicts.

I agree the LTT issue was overblown, but only because Linus' ego allowed it to escalate from what could've been a small annoyance to a much larger one.  But y'all blaming Launchpad for the fact that you clearly failed to build / upload a number of packages including the dependencies for the Pop specific build of Steam is really a hoot and a half.  

The overall trend of your response is that it never is System 76's fault.  You have spent your entire response, victim blaming and pointing the finger at everybody else.  You have accepted absolutely zero responsibility for any of the issues present in Pop either in the past or at the current time.

...and this is why I switched.  I want a decent distro without all the drama and all the finger pointing.  Y'all got a lot of drama swirling around you, whether it be with the LFS project, the Gnome project, your own userbase, Canonical or whomever else.

Yep, I just looked back at at the actual [github issue](https://github.com/pop-os/beta/issues/221) regarding the problem and the repo URLs in the comments all reference apt.pop-os.org which of course is where your packages lived after Launchpad and still live today.  If they were missing there as well (and they clearly were) then blaming Launchpad for the failure to publish correctly comes off as more than a little bullshitty.

So yeah you are either very hazy on the actual details and need to correct yourself, or you are purposefully lying in an attempt to detract from the point I am trying to make.

Figuring out which is an exercise best left to the dedicated few who are still reading our back and forth.  I'm clearly biased.

Then you go off on blaming issues you had in the beta with being a flaw in our process. We purposely make betas available with known bugs for those who want to encounter and report issues. And without people reporting issues there's a good likelihood that they won't be discovered until after release.

You're also expecting too much from the apt to be handle to handle any third party repository added to it without issue. All it takes is a single third party PPA modifying and replacing essential files and packages to sabotage the entire dependency resolution process, or to cause a package script to fail mid-upgrade. Even though pop-upgrade performs a dry-run of the upgrade before it upgrades, it doesn't have any knowledge that a postrm or postinst script will fail.

This most recent upgrade caused issues for all who had the Pipewire PPA installed. That's not a coincidence. The Wine PPA is commonly a cause of past upgrade failures. These repositories are not vetted by anyone here and the people maintaining them may have made conflicting changes that can't be undone.

The same will happen with any Linux distribution. Go ahead and mix Arch repositories with Manjaro repositories, or play with a bunch of copr repositories on Fedora replacing core Fedora dependencies. Conflicts will happen.

> Uh huh. And yet.... the packages from the previous distro (IIRC was 21.04) were perfectly fine and in place. Also IIRC this happened AFTER ya'll switched away from launchpad.

This is a blatant lie, and it's also accusing me of lying about the cause of the incident. I've been working full time on Pop since 2018, so I was there at the time this happened. The issue you're referring to happened during the 21.04 release.

Here's an excerpt from the 21.10 changelog noting that this release is transitioning from Launchpad to apt.pop-os.org.

https://github.com/pop-os/upgrade/blob/master/changelogs/21.10#L28

Here are the git commits that made that happen for Impish upgrades in September and October.

- https://github.com/pop-os/iso/commit/6cb91c5e97a80f204c7a4c6ec83474aea69d1b58
- https://github.com/pop-os/default-settings/commit/16e4a1e9f219d275f7e667c15528e1160cd29f2e
- https://github.com/pop-os/upgrade/commit/38a0ee11afd31c79af71431ca66f9aa934f993f8

Check the date of the LTT incident, then check the date that 21.10 released. Pop 21.10 released in December. The LTT incident happened in September. Interesting how we committed to making a transition to apt.pop-os.org at the same time. Coincidence? Or driven by the fact that we needed to do this to prevent another LTT incident in the future?

Since the upgrade, all my games, whether they're run using wine (such as Maniaplanet) or natively (such as Portal 2) are having huge lagging periods, randomly, without anything different than usual happening on screen. As an example, in Maniaplanet i have 60 fps constantly, but it jumps to \~12 fps every 15-20 seconds for 3-4 seconds. They all worked perfectly on 21.04 and 21.10. I have tried lowering the settings to the minimum with no success whatsoever. 

Is there any way to debug this or know what's causing it?

1173,comment,2,i78ks95,,"I come from 15 years of software development on a Mac, and here is why I switched to Linux (Pop!_OS) in 2021.

Mac OS seems as strong as ever, but a trickle of software developers have been disenfranchised by Apple’s [increasing](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/06/1025402725/apple-iphone-for-child-sexual-abuse-privacy) demand for [control](https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/15/apple-explains-addresses-mac-privacy-concerns/) over its [hardware](https://www.iclarified.com/78310/apple-blocks-camera-repair-on-new-iphone-12-video), which diminishes the importance of values like ownership, the right to repair, and free-culture.

In November 2020, my MacBook ground to a halt. Apps wouldn't load, and rebooting didn't help. I assumed something had gone seriously wrong with my hardware--a bad hard drive, perhaps? It turned out that the cause was [Apple's server outage](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25074959). Until that point, I had no idea Apple had programmed a control mechanism (which catastrophically failed that day) that could prevent me from running already-installed apps on my system. I woke up.

Today, Apple [removes apps](https://www.thefpsreview.com/2022/04/24/apple-to-remove-apps-and-games-that-havent-been-updated-in-two-years/) from its app store because they haven't been updated, and decides for everyone who likes Mac OS whether their next hardware upgrade will or will not have a touchbar, or [escape key](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/10/25/13409258/apple-new-macbook-pro-no-escape-key). It's an ecosystem problem, and a culture problem. I think Apple's ""Think Different"" slogan embodies much of the free culture aspect that drew me to the company in the first place. Apple is no longer the Think Different company.

While I appreciate Apple's general sense of design, having no choice in these matters made me realize how much I value freedom, and so I've started a journey to appreciate and improve the ecosystem of free software, and that includes Linux--and Pop!_OS.",pop_os,1651628574.0

1260,post,1,uheuov,[Fix] USB to TTL disconnection issue,"Creating this post to help anyone who's facing a similar issue.

If you are a hobbyist/maker you probably use USB to TTL (Serial) converters. After updating to 22.04 I had an issue where the device was detected and after a few seconds, it would disconnect. So here's the fix:

Your USB to TTL dongle and a Braille display probably uses the same chip, so a package called brltty takes over your dongle.

1. Run `lsusb` and you should get something similar to this: `Bus 002 Device 006: ID 10c4:ea60 Silicon Labs CP210x UART Bridge`.
2. Copy the ID part, ie `10c4:ea60`.
3. Run `sudo nano /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/85-brltty.rules`.
4. Search by using Ctrl+W and paste the ID using Ctrl+Shift+V.
5. Comment out the last line where it says `ENV{PRODUCT}`:

```
    # Device: 10C4:EA60
    # Generic Identifier
    # Vendor: Cygnal Integrated Products, Inc.
    # Product: CP210x UART Bridge / myAVR mySmartUSB light
    # BrailleMemo [Pocket]
    # Seika [Braille Display]
    # ENV{PRODUCT}==""10c4/ea60/*"", ATTRS{manufacturer}==""Silicon Labs"", ENV{BRLTTY_BRAILLE_DRIVER}=""sk"", GOTO=""brltty_usb_run""
```
6. Save and Restart your computer.

1289,post,5,uhcr68,A review of Pop!_OS- 1 month later,"I am coming from a macOS system, and becuase it was a Unix based system, I THOUGHT it would be easy to switch. For some parts, like updating the system and getting all my apps downloaded was easy. 

Why Pop!_OS? - I chose it because it was based on Ubuntu and I liked the DE

What wasn’t so easy for me was how easily I can break the system.

How I have blackscreened my computer:
Installing KDE (removed it via tty)
Installing i3 (removed it via tty)
Installing dwm (removed it via tty)

Issues with the computer and general Linux compatibility:

RGB keyboard does not work ( have tried many tools)
Refresh rate is locked at 60 Hz
Ui scaling - it was so small on my 1440p monitor and ginormous on my external 1080p monitors. 

The good - it worked!

The interface of GNOME is great. I didn’t like using full screen mode on any apps that are not games so I installed dash to panel. This broke workspaces. I have to refresh gnome every once in a while (alt+f2 and then type r) but it generally works fine

I have a bunch of gnome extensions for monitoring computer stats in the panel, and this is something that macOS didn’t have. I couldn’t monitor the system in the menu bar without paying money.

I like GNOME more than KDE. It is so much more simpler with the theming and how the layout works. The extensions are also pretty cool

Games - all the games that I want to play mostly work with Linux. If you do a driver update and forget to reboot, some games will crash. Not too big of an issue, just something I noticed

Some games will work better with the steam flatpak version (CSGO)

General everyday use - works very well and uses almost no ram while having 15-20 tabs open in Firefox. NordVPN works great. You need to reboot before using it for the first time

VMs - qemu works very well for windows and other Linux VMs. I just need to figure out how to get NVIDIA gpu pass through for it to work better.

Performance- gnome shell and apps take up very little CPU usage and ram. 

Overall Linux has been very good and has has almost no issues. I love how much I can customize the DE and the OS.",pop_os,1651572380.0

1319,post,37,uh8n50,22.04 dependency upgrade issue,"I wanted to post here in the event someone else ran into the same issue I did after trying to upgrade to 22.04. I'm not a Linux guru or anything, but I was able to figure out my issue and I wanted to share.

Initially when the ""upgrade"" for 22.04 was available, it went smooth, but after the restart of the OS and before the full install of 22.04 I had some dependency issues I ran into. I found something similar on the github for popos 22.04 beta here: [https://github.com/pop-os/beta/issues/370](https://github.com/pop-os/beta/issues/370)

I tried running the commands they recommended in the post but got the following:

Provided:

sudo apt clean

sudo apt update -m

sudo dpkg --configure -a

sudo apt install -f

sudo apt full-upgrade

sudo apt autoremove --purge

&#x200B;

EDIT:Not sure what happened but the rest of the post is missing. The TLDR version:

Upon upgrading I ran into multiple symbolic link errors, prior to installing the new upgrade, along with the other errors shown in the github link from above (My errors were much longer as I had more dependency/symbolic link errors - symbolic link errors were because the links already existed for some reason). I had to remove these links from /usr/bin (add-apt-repository & apt-add-repository). I used sudo dpkg --configure -a to check if the symbolic links were still showing. Once they did not, I ran sudo apt install -f to force update the dependencies that were missing (also shown in the github link) BEFORE rerunning sudo dpkg --configure -a. After doing this the upgrade was installed with no issues. The order of the commands used was:

sudo apt clean

sudo apt update -m

sudo apt install -f

sudo dpkg --configure -a

sudo apt full-upgrade

sudo apt autoremove --purge",pop_os,1651554033.0

Had this issue for a long time where if I press and hold a button on the keyboard and press the side keys of my mouse (which act as keyboard keys say button 4) my WoW (World of Warcraft) will just freeze or stutter very badly.   I've had this for 6+ months easily.

So i can hit the side mouse key (left/right don't seem to make this happen) repeatedly and no lag is noticed.

I can hit or hold a key repeatedly on the keyboard and no lag/freezing noticed.

As soon as I hit both a keyboard and a mouse buttons at the same time, the game will just momentarly freeze with every press.  This is both audio and video that freezes.

1329,post,6,uh533n,Problems with samba in 22.04,"So I've updated to 22.04 and wanted to see if I could play my ps2 games again from the network. For this I needed samba, but it's not working for me, maybe due to the update to samba 5 broke both nautilus-share and nemo-share?

&#x200B;

Anyways, since I was using nemo due to a prior problem with nautilus (which fixed itself I guess) and hooked up nemo-share (had to install via a .deb due to the package not being in the pop repo) and I was met with this odd message:

net usershare add: share name contains invalid characters (where??? in the ""/"" ?)  


So after nemo failed on me, tried to go to nautilus, installed the extensions and appeared to have worked:

Then I removed samba and its dependencies and tried to install everything through nautilus in the ""ubuntu way"" hooked up the extension and it did prompt to install the necessary programs and it failed, checked on terminal and saw this:

I'm running on a lemp9 with integrated Intel graphics only.

If I'm reading this correctly, the graphics driver is crashing? The video plays fine with ffplay, mpv, and VLC, so it seems limited to the Videos app.

Is anyone else experiencing this? Is this an indicator that a driver didn't get updated? Happy to receive any tips/suggestions.",pop_os,1651540728.0

I don't do anything to production without a test first, so I built a quick VM to crash test the script post-build and it just works.

    ${BGre}pop-gdm-set-background${BGre} script (for changing Pop!_OS ${BWhi}22.04${RCol} GDM Background) HELP
    
    there are four options
    1. background with image
    2. background with color
    3. background with gradient horizontal ( requires two valid hex color inputs)
    4. background with gradient vertical ( requires two valid hex color inputs)
    
    ${BWhi}Tip:${RCol} be ready with valid hex color code in place of below example like #aAbBcC or #dDeEfF. Change them to your preffered hex color codes.
    you may choose colors from ${BBlu}https://www.color-hex.com/${RCol}
    
    Example Commands:
    
    1. ${BWhi}sudo ./pop-gdm-set-background --image ${BGre}/home/user/backgrounds/image.jpg${RCol}
    2. ${BWhi}sudo ./pop-gdm-set-background --color \#aAbBcC${RCol}

    ${BWhi}Why RESCUE_MODE?${RCol}
    It is when you try to change the background with some other scripts and then interacted with this script,
    there will be some conflicts. In case you ran other scripts to change the background and then tried this script,
    found conflicts? then add 'rescue' to the end of the command as mentiond above.

And no, for all I understand (I think mmstick talked about that) it won't just become the default for news installation, as I read it, it is supposed to simply replace GNOME on existing installations.

While restricting users may not be their official philosophy, especially with their Cosmic DE it does feel that way. Writing a whole new DE from scratch including Wayland support written from scratch without any plans to make it as seemless as possible for users to switch does sound a lot like restrictions.

And no ""you don't have to worry about something that hasn't been made yet"" is the worst statement you can make. It is already in the works. So those points should have been figured out by now.

I checked a bit Zorin seems to use PulseAudio so that's where the issue lies, I think - my dac seems to pack a tad bit more of punch there - which is missing on Pop and many other newer distros than Zorin probably due to PipeWire usage.

I believe this is being caused by a bad config somewhere in my home folder, because it doesn't happen on newly created, root or recovery users.

Is anyone else having this problem? And if so, what worked for you?

Ex: I create LibreOffice file in my `Template` folder named ""Writer.odt"". If I want to make a .odt file it will DIRECTLY be named ""Writer.odt"" and next I have to edit to whatever I want.

Is there a way (plugin or extension) that can mimic Windows ""new file"" behavior or Linux ""New Folder"" behavior?

Please don't say ""Use command line"" because I already know it.

Taking power over your privacy and data away from these companies (MS, Google, Apple, FB, etc) is a long, tedious and complicated process, and requires learning a lot about new things (in my case it was NAS options, which one would fit me, then learn about the one I chose, then look for replacements for what I was being provided by these companies, yeah, lots of researching and learning). 

At the end of the day, there will always be a compromise between privacy/security and convenience. For example, sometimes I miss my Google photos just making pictures better, or creating a moments video and recognizing everyone in my pictures (which is also one of the creepiest parts of it), but now I run Photoprism in my UnRAID NAS, and it's nowhere near as featured filled as Gphotos, but I have full control of all my pics and videos. 

Even after all this work, I still rely on Google for my main email (although I'm starting the adventure of making my own email server to use with my domain name, but that's a LONG way out yet) and to use my phone, since it's a Pixel 6 Pro, so it relies on a Google account to function properly. 

Each of us have to find the balance that works best for us. For me is, giving Google ONLY the least control possible over my data, while having a less integrated experience in my digital life. 

As for Linux vs Windows, well, I can play most games in Pop OS, most of those even perform better than in Windows, but as you say, then there are those that just won't even open. 

For that, I play on PS5, and just disregard the ones that ONLY work on Windows and/or MacOS. Yeah, I have the option of creating a gaming VM for Windows, my UnRAID server has enough power to run maybe even 2 of those concurrently, but that would mean getting a Windows License, plus the ridiculous amount of time to install, Windows updates, maintenance, etc. 

So, yeah, Windows is out of my life for good.",pop_os,1651759390.0

Previously I just had to press F1, click and drag the mouse over the desired area, and paste the image into my document. But in 22.04 pressing the shortcut brings up a pre-selected region with handles at the corners. If I want to select a region not entirely contained within the pre-selected one, I can just click and drag as usual. But if the region is inside the default one, it seems I have to use the handles to resize it. This takes extra time.

Also, after selecting the desired area, it seems I have to press Enter or Spacebar to copy it to my clipboard, which again takes extra time.

Its performance was pretty flaky,  crashed/rebooted itself when trying to run Brave, and the keyboard and touchpad stopped working.  Was ready to toss it when I thought I'd try Pop\_OS.

The GPU are hybrid Intel (integrated) and Nvidia (discrete).  At first I tried installing the Nvidia version of Pop\_OS but all I got was black screen.  Installing the Intel version worked fine, keyboard and touchpad working again so I assume that was something to do with OSX drivers.

My issue is that sometimes apps seem to freeze.  I'm thinking it's to do with the hybrid graphics, and an issue when the Nvidia GPU wants to kick in.  I note that Pop\_OS does support hybrid graphics, but not sure if the version of P\_OS I installed is the correct one.

Title I am trying to play: Horizon: Zero Dawn

Issues:

\- XBox Elite Series 2 Controller is connected via bluetooth. After a few minutes (or after haptic feedback / cutscene) it stops responding and last input will not let up (e.g. if running will keep running) and nothing will stop the character (not even keyboard). Only fix is to turn off the controller and turn it back on again.

\- Fullscreen. It is always fullscreen! I can not exit it no matter what. F11 does nothing. Ctrl Alt F7 makes the screen black and unresponsive. Esc doesnt work. I want to be able to have the game running in a resizeable window, or at the very least get it into window mode so I can minimize it / switch apps if needed.

\- Monitor switching. I have to monitors. Normally I just have one on, but sometimes I use two. When I swtich from single display to join displays under System>Displays it never remembers my display preference (location, resolution, scale, refresh rate, etc). How to fix.

\- Default audio: when the computer restarts I always have to switch the settings to detect the speakers. Is there a way to specify that it should always pick this device whenever it is detected.",pop_os,1651440496.0

Now that wouldn't be much of a problem if the errors weren't: ""contact costumer support"" but thats a rant I have to hammer into the heads of nordvpn devs so back to the point. 

nordvpn uses a deamon to connect and stuff so I decided to take a look at what it's outputing. What I found was that it's trying to use a command called systemd-resolve but it seems that the executable no longer exists, or is no longer in $PATH. Looking up more articles on how the hell can I get it back, I am atleast 96% sure that it has been replaced by another command or replaced by one of its synonyms.

So whats on my mind now is to get a symlink to the now new command, call it systemd-resolve, and call it a day. I can probably figure it out on my own but today is sunday and I've already spent a good 2 hours trying to figure out who to point the finger to.

> I deleted the HD, and all the data on it. I got the drive formatted, erased, and all set up and began transferring files from my SSd to the HD to free up space. 

You deleted the Partitions on the Drive, then remade partitions and formated them to some filesystem.. **what filesystem did you use?**   

>> . In the middle of this process, I suddenly became unable to write to the HD. 

If a filesystem corruption or hard drive issue is detected, the system can remount the filesystem to be READ ONLY to protect the data on the drive. 

If you monitor the output of `sudo dmesg -w` in a terminal as you do stuff to the drive, you may see some error messages. 


>> I checked my permissions and found the drive was owned by root.

Did you change the ownership somehow? It should be owned by root, or one of your users.


>> I've tried using ""sudo -i passwd root"" to set a password for root so I could log in and change the permissions,

Not needed.    If you have sudo rights, then you already have root rights and can change permissions.  There is no need to set a root password, or log in as root.

>> but my system doesn't accept any input for the password, either my account pass or the new pass I tried to set for root. 

faq 'Problem' -  the `Password:` field in the Console does NOT ECHO ANY INPUT. It does not show *'s or anything as you type. You type in blindly. Nothing will be shown on the screen.  This is a security feature, not all Distros do this. 


>>  I am also able to find the drive where it should be, using ""cd"" and ""ls"" so I can navigate there. 

Your Filesystem is still mounted.


> But how do I change the permissions, 

If an issue has made the filesystem read only - You dont.  If its not read only, then you use 'chown' and 'chmod' as needed. DEPENDING ON THE FILESYSTEM.

GParted says it's ext4, I'm guessing that was right since, at one point, I had write permissions. 

>Monitor the output of sudo dmesg -w

This shows some errors involving a graphics driver, but I don't see any talking about the drive. 

>Did you change the ownership?

I don't believe so, it says the drive is owned by root

>Not needed. If you have sudo rights then you already have root

Ah, okay. 

>faq 'problem'

I don't mean in command line, I mean in the user login, and I should've been more clear. It does show what I type, or dots depending if I have it revealed or not, but it always says the password is wrong. Though, since I don't need to access the root account, I suppose this is irrelevant now anyway. 

>Use the sudo command to access root rights

I've used sudo before, but I don't know how to use it to change the permissions of this drive. My thought process is that since root owns the drive, if I could log in with root, I could set the drive to read and write by others on the system, so I can access it. I'm relatively new to Linux, only being on pop for a few months, and I used Ubuntu like over a decade ago, so I don't know much on how to handle seemingly random withdrawal of my write ability to this specific drive.

I'm currently running 21.10 and my system is rock solid. I've tweaked the look and feel and made some specific changes to stock COSMIC to be better aligned aesthetically to what I want and I'm loathed to update right now since I'm sure things will get messed up and I kind of don't want to go through the hassles of fiddling away to get it back to a place it was before the upgrade.

I'm leaning to skipping 22.04 in favour of 22.10 since I feel that the .10 updates are more stable and polished than the .04 ones.

Heavily optimized for Intel chips, but also showing improvements on AMD. But all for the cost of limited software support since most of that optimizations is done to the packages. So you can use any of the shelf deb or whatever packages, you can only use what Intel is putting the effort in to optimize.

And of course you can go even more light weight if you make your own distribution that only has to run on your hardware.

1875,post,1,ufxl46,Issue with Steam library and secondary drive,"New to Linux. Just installed Pop_os on my machine 2 days ago. It was previously on Windows 11. I went in to this thinking I could still use my old steam library I had on a 1TB SSD that was on windows. Upgrade went well. Installed Steam and tried to have it find my old library. Did not go well. 

Basically the bug is, Steam can't write to that drive as it is ""read only""

I did some Googling and found a few potential fixes. Some posts said the drive needed formatting as it was in a file system only windows used, since it was a prior windows drive. Others said there was a problem with ""dual booting"" witch made since as I still had windows stuff on that drive and another not previously mentioned.

I have tried recommended fixes from said posts to no avail. I also tried changing who's allowed to write to the drive in the drives properties. But that change wouldn't save. It would keep reverting back to read only

So I thought my best option at this point was a format of the drive. And that's what I did. Using the disks tool that pop os comes with I formatted my game drive and my extra drive. That was night 1

Last night I got on and partitioned both drives. And tried again

""Steam library must be on a drive with execute permissions"" (I think that's what it said. I'm writing this post at work so I can't make sure)

I went back into the drive properties and it's still showing read only permissions for Steam. (To my understanding this would be the 3rd permissions group under the group with my username) I tried to change it to write permissions and the change still won't keep. 

So I'm at a dead end. And I'm too much of a Linux noob to figure this out. What am I doing wrong here?",pop_os,1651403144.0
1876,comment,3,i6wfzxm,,"what is the current **filesystem** in use on that drive?

if it's NTFS, you MUST mount the filesystem.wirh the proper options to make it owned by your user, and with the proper permissions.

example fstab entry:

       Example STEAM Entry.
       UUID=38CE9483CE943AD8 /home/bob/storage ntfs-3g uid=1000,gid=1000,rw,user,exec,umask=000 0 0

then you can tell steam to make a steam library on that filesystem.


If the thing is using ext4 or other Linux filesystem, the process is similar.

make a fstab entry.  example:

        


    UUID=38CE94838 /home/bob/gamedisk ext4  nofail, defaults 0 0

Mount the filesystem,  THEN you make the mountpoint owned by your user.

       sudo chown bob.bob /home/Bob/gamedisk

-------




Generic copy paste Notes I made for people trying to use steam under Linux and keeping game files on a NTFS partition.

don't use the file manager to mount the filesystem
setup a fstab line to mount it at boot time
you do NOT (typically) use chown or chmod on a mounted NTFS.
example fstab entry.

        UUID=1234-your-uuid-56789 /media/gamedisk ntfs-3g uid=1000,gid=1000,rw,user,exec,umask=000 0 0 
On Ubuntu you can use 'ntfs' instead of ntfs-3g if you have ntfs-3g installed , it auto changes NTFS to be ntfs-3g. Other distribution may differ.

Newer Distribution and kernels may use the ntfs3 driver, I have not tested that driver.

The various issues and problems with ntfs getting mounted Read Only still apply. (hit up the numerous NTFS under Linux guides for more information)

And ..

it's best to not use ntfs for your games if it can be avoided, it can be slower and more of a CPU load.

also.. there are a lot of bad/wrong/old posts/blogs/guides on this topic. so watch out for those.

This guide may be outdated or wrong when ntfs3 comes out. (if that ever becomes commonplace) 

bonus tip.

How did you install steam? You are using the flatpak version or the apt/deb version?  `flatpak list` will show if you are using flatpak.

I just tested and made a new steam storage partition on a small ssd, and basically just...

formatted the filesystem to ext4.

Mounted it it with the defaults, option in fstab.   

did 'sudo chown bob.bob /home/bob/steamstorage  


ls -l shows the mountpoint owned by my user.

then fired up steam and added it to my steam library and installed a game to it. 

it made a steamapps directory and a libraryfolder.vdf file both are owned by my user, and show executable.

Starting with 22.04 the keys to sign a repo need to be saved as separate .gpg files. The old apt-key method that stores all inside the trusted.gpg is strongly discouraged.

So while that might be created by the slack package itself, I think the package in the pop repo should just be updated to create the file itself and then modify permissions so the file won't be constantly modified.

I know because I used to run Pop 20.04, and the kernel was upgraded to 10.15 before it even came to Arch Linux, and while users were still having problems with devices not working.

2018,post,6,uft4f6,My personal experience with ditching Win10,"Personal rig:

Ryzen 1600, 16gb ram, WD NVME SDD 1TB, EVGA Super 1060 GTX 6gb, and 3 tb in HDD. 

Ended up deciding to go full bore to Ubuntu after reading about the bloated hardware requirements for Win11. I had wanted to do this months ago, but APex and anti-cheat wasnt supported on yet. Once I learned it was, I took the leap.

Notes that I had to get Apex to run smoothly;

Grab the recompiled shader cache. If not your first load time will be like 3 hours as it complies everything in the vulkan engine. 

Install gamemode and add it to the launch options along with the +max\_fps=0. 

Install the lastest NVIDIA drivers using pop shop. 

NVIDIA settings will not save and load unless you save it to the config file. If this fails with its saying it cant open it for writing, follow this page: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/csglyi/ubuntu\_1904\_unable\_to\_open\_x\_config\_file/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/csglyi/ubuntu_1904_unable_to_open_x_config_file/) Then run the setting control panel in terminal `sudo nvidia-settings`

Also if you are having issues with screen tearing, follow this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ux9bz\_Tfw0&ab\_channel=IntelligentGaming-Linux%2CWindows%26Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ux9bz_Tfw0&ab_channel=IntelligentGaming-Linux%2CWindows%26Tutorials)

So I created an Ubuntu 22.04 VM and it works perfectly fine in the VM (with the same packages installed; yes, I have a list of packages I want to install after a fresh install).

On Pop, I had to install `zsh-autosuggestions` and add the following lines (using `compinstall`) to my `~/.zshrc`:

```
zstyle ':completion:*' completer _expand _complete _ignored _correct
zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list '+'
zstyle :compinstall filename '/home/pratham/.zshrc'

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```

I also have a Pop!_OS 22.04 VM (for my work) which has 2 cores (threads) and 4 Gigs of RAM. Copying the same `.zshrc` file to that VM [to enable tab completion] will result an issue where, if I type some command, press tab expecting it to be automatically completed, I won't see the auto-completed command until I press another alphanumeric key. The terminal does not update text when I invoke auto complete by pressing a tab until I press an alphanumeric key.

Call it a hobby, call it a weird obsession, whatever haha... but recently I've always been coming back to Pop! I find this interesting as I actually like vanilla gnome, a lot. So I've been thinking about it and for me, it comes down to two things that Pop does really well:

* I have a laptop with nvidia optimus, Pop works best out of the box. I think there's no discussion to be had here. When I connect to my internal monitor, switch to nvidia, otherwise it's on hybrid
* system76-power > power-profiles-daemon, at least on my system. Pop is the distro I get decent battery life on. 

and 1 thing any distro with vanilla gnome isn't doing so well at the moment:

* It's in this transition phase where it's not full libadwaita yet. I don't theme, so I'm fine with libatwaita (controversial in this subreddit?), but really don't like the current state where some apps are there and some aren't. 

finally, I've recently turned a corner with the overall aesthetic of Pop. Didn't used to like the default theme or icons, but have come to appreciate them vs. alternative.

I love the way POP-Shop shows the choices of .deb and flatpak and the amount of space it would take up on either of the choices and of installing for the user or for the entire system.

I purchased UKUU to update the Linux Kernels myself wish POP\_OS comes with its own utility like Manjaro to upgrade the kernels seemlessly.

To me if Linux desktop distro its Pop\_OS these days.  I havent seen a compulsion to use any other flavor of linux just because of a software not available on the debian/ubuntu based platform.  (At least to me I have not found any AUR package, I desperately needed but none existed for Pop-OS).

The only features specific to System76 boards would be managing battery thresholds and some fan curves. Perhaps also some tweaks to graphics switching on some open firmware systems. Everything else is generic functionality exposed by Linux that's common to all Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA systems.

One such generic feature is the kernel's power platform profiles, which only a few Lenovo boards use at the moment. Another is AMD and Intel scaling governors and Linux's generic cpufreq driver. Or how all systems with NVIDIA switchable graphics are implemented the same way.

System76 Scheduler and other System76/Pop projects are the same. I'm not that great at picking names for projects so System76 Scheduler is the best my brain had at the time.

> if it was more of an upstream project instead of a PopOS!/System76 project.

2175,comment,1,i72bmup,,"This is being caused by a bug in the repolib preinstallation script and a PR is open to get it fixed which should be released soon. In the meantime, if you are experiencing this issue you can workaround it by running the following commands:

    sudo apt update
    sudo unlink /usr/bin/add-apt-repository
    sudo unlink /usr/bin/apt-add-repository
    sudo dpkg --configure -a
    sudo apt install -f
    sudo apt full-upgrade

This issue should only be occurring on certain subsets of Pop installs, and will only occur if the `software-properties-common` package is removed prior to installing/upgrading/reinstalling the `python3-repolib` package. If you're concerned about hitting this issue before performing an upgrade, the following should ensure that you are good to go (without causing damage to your system if it would not have caused problems):

    if [[ `dpkg -s software-properties-common | grep 'Status'` = *'installed'* ]]; then echo Your system is not susceptible to the bug!; else sudo unlink /usr/bin/add-apt-repository; sudo unlink /usr/bin/apt-add-repository; echo Bug mitigated; fi

Simply copy-paste the entire command into a terminal and press enter to check/mitigate the issue. It will check whether your system has the trigger condition or not (missing `software-properties-common`) and then remove the offending files if so.",pop_os,1651518912.0

I am currently using a Dell XPS 15 7590 running the latest Pop!Os 22.04.

I am having troubles finding the right power option setup on lid closing. I want to get rid of the default suspend option. Deactivating it from the Gnome tweak wasn't enough, so I edited the `~/etc/systemd/logind.conf`  setting `HandleLidSwitch=ignore` and `HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=ignore` . It worked: after a reboot the laptop stopped suspending when closing the lid.

Now I would like it to lock when closing the lid, so I don't have the screen lighted up when the lid is closed! But the settings `HandleLidSwitch=lock` and `HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=lock` seem to be completely ineffective: everything is exactly as it was with the `'ignore'` option.

The screen locking perfectly works from both command line and top-right corner system menu.

Any suggestion on how to solve this? why is systemd ignoring my `'lock'` command?

&#x200B;

EDIT: it looks like the Gnome-Tweaks tool once set on ""do not suspend when lid closed"" was inhibiting systemd from handling the lid switch at all, resulting in the screen not locking.

`gnome-tweak-lid-switch-inhibitor` was in fact shown among the inhibitors printed by the command `systemd-inhibit --list` .

Solved simply removing Gnome-tweaks through `$ sudo apt-get remove --auto-remove gnome-tweaks` 

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,

2205,post,3,ufe9ho,pop_os 22.04 in vm - performance issue(s),"Hi all,

I am trying to play with new the pop\_os 22.04 release on Vmware Windows (specs for the guest: 4gb ram and 8gb for graphics. 4 processors) . Unfortunately the system performance is very bad. For example, I noticed that pipewire hovers around 50% cpu usage even when there is no audio output from any app (although I seem to have solved this problem by downgrading the kernel from 5.16 to 5.15). Audio does not work either.

Other examples ... Moving windows around feels very choppy. Or when I just move the mouse rapidly around (with just the htop terminal open), processes like Xorg and gnome-shell spike in cpu usage. And so on ... Everything is basically very slow.

Does anybody have an idea whether this is a user error on my end? Has anybody else tested this?

Thanks for reading my first post here.

Yesterday my laptop speakers started  crackling out of nowhere which was shortly but not instantly followed by  the audio on my laptop stopping completely, now originally my audio  output showed up as being speakers (despite the speakers clearly not  working) and didnt recognize it when I plugged in my headphones.

  
I restarted my laptop and it worked for about 20 minutes before stopping  again, this time it had my headphones set as the output device and once  again there was no sound.   
No matter what I did the laptop audio would  continue working for a little while and stop working for a much longer  while, at one point I plugged in a USB microphone which did work as an  input device which made me believe that the issue was with the headphone  jack.   
Then around 2 hours ago the audio was working fine with the speakers and  all of a sudden my laptop told me I had plugged in my headphones,  something which I had not done, and preceeded to say it switch to  headset output and the audio stopped working again. 

  
Now as I'm writing this I've done a clean install of Ubuntu and  restarted my laptop several times and all this seems to have achieved is  that now my laptop doesnt even recognize the existence of any output or  input devices or seemingly even the concept of sound on my laptop. I thought I had fixed this as all the sound seemed to be working fine but open logging out of my laptop for the night the sound had yet again disappeared in the morning.

Throughout all of this as well I have not been able to do anything in relation to PulseAudio as for some bloody reason whenever I write a  pulseaudio command it claims that it doesnt recognize it and tells me to  use sudo apt install pulseaudiobut then when I try and do that I get this result:

2268,post,1,ufalh5,How to control bluetooth media from phone with pause/play buttons,"For podcasts I use podcast-addict and since there is no desktop version of it I needed an alternative.I do not want to use another service that can't sync to podcast-addict (if there is one that can sync playlists/subscriptions for desktop, feel free to tell me)After trying Anbox and realizing that no longer seems to work due to missing stuff in the kernel (something with binder/ashmen?), started looking into just using Bluetooth to my phone.

I can connect an play audio from my phone and hear it on my desktop but the media controls do not recognize it. I hear audio and according to settings it comes from 'WirePlumber' (no idea what that is).  I do not see it in the notification area, nor in `playerctl -l`.I was able to use d-bus commands to send pause or play, and that worked however it wasn't completely what I wanted since I would still have to setup shortcuts.I saw [somewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/6h0jkm/bluetooth_media_controls/) that I should do `mpris-proxy` however that command does not seem to exist (even though I have bluez).

I would love if there was a way connect Bluetooth so I can see the current media name and pause/play button when looking in notifications, similar to how the Spotify Client has it.

I am very new to Linux (week 3) so don't be scared to over-explain.

I love the switch to pipewire specifically on my desktop where I use a Yeti Pro, and pulse audio would never respect my setting of the output to any other source, it always changed back to the monitor on the yeti mic. In terms of audio switching, I wish Pop OS would natively support it in the system menu rather than having to dig for it in settings, or using an extension, but even when having to use that I'm not disappointed with the options.

2335,comment,1,i6sc686,,"I don't think the upgrade process is meant to be interrupted at that stage (before the reboot). At least, you should not do any package installations or upgrades at this point.

I'd need to check, but I assume that the steps before the reboot are;

1. change the repos to jammy
2. download all packages

and after the reboot these packages are installed.

So you can delay the reboot to finish and save some work, but you should not delay it for very long, since any updates or other package operations won't work.

With that said, there is no reboot hook, as this problem persists for a few days now and I did restart my PC multiple times, with no upgrade taking place.

I started to notice this behaviour after the upgrade to Pop\_OS! 21.10 (GNOME 40) from 21.04 (GNOME 3.x), the latter working as intended. The recent upgrade to 22.04 retains the problems.

At first I thought it had maybe something to do with Pop itself or the Ubuntu base and went for Manjaro 21.2.2 with GNOME 41 - same problem. Running XFCE or Plasma had the fullscreen streaming working as intended in comparison.

So this strange behaviour seems to have to do something with GNOME 40+.

Is this something of a known issue that I'm unable to google the solution to, or is there something else I could provide to find a solution?

2489,comment,3,i6s0xor,,"> Wayland is ready in fedora.

Wayland is no more ready in Fedora than it is in any other distribution. Fedora chooses to uses it by default because this is how Fedora does things, and Fedora has generally users who are apt enough to switch to Xorg when Wayland doesn't work.

Also Fedora doesn't have to support paying (via hardware) users like System76 does for Pop, so choosing Wayland over Xorg makes no difference in that respect.

As for Secure Boot, Fedora, again, supports Secure Boot (although a lot of user input is required with nVidia), because Fedora needs to be supporting everything new or hard to setup etc. It's their philosophy.

Pop doesn't and probably won't support secure boot for some time, because it's mostly necessary to its platform, and its user base doesn't need it (as I'm certain most people obsessing with it also don't, they just nag about it).

Finally, Fedora is my preferred distribution for many things, so if you find it fits your needs, I can't see why you, or others, just don't use Fedora, instead of pointing out/nagging about what Pop doesn't ""support"".",pop_os,1651317422.0

I am trying to play New World on Steam, I am a new Linux adopter and won't be going back, but I really want to play this game! I got the launch options from ProtonDB, where it seems people are getting it to run pretty easily after EAC got updated.

[Neofetch result](https://imgur.com/Hhjx3BO)

Software: Pop!\_OS 22.04 (nvidia), nvidia driver 510.68.02 from pop shop, Steam (flatpak) from PopShop, Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime installed, Proton Experimental compatibility, Shader Precaching enabled.

Steam Launch Options: bash -c 'exec ""${@/NewWorldLauncher.exe/bin64/NewWorld.exe}""' -- %command%

The game loads through the welcome screen, can select character, but when loading into the world it crashes. I have actually been able to get in game and play, but the game crashes when teleporting into an area with a LOT of objects, like a town. I've had stable gameplay in the open world, but I don't know if that's a red herring.

    sudo apt install grub-efi-amd64 
    sudo bootctl remove 
    sudo grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootl

I'll also add that installed [dark matter grub theme](https://github.com/vandalsoul/darkmatter-grub2-theme), not sure if that's relevant but that's the order in which things happened. Followed by a reboot and the following images.

When I rebooted I was met with [this grub terminal](https://i.imgur.com/qCC9Q1L.png), where I've no idea to even start. 

I went to my UEFI BIOS to check that perhaps I just needed to change the boot priority to see [that my windows drive has disappeared](https://i.imgur.com/r3ly5la.png). I have my pop os installed on a 500gb drive and my windows install on a 120gb drive. But the BIOS is seeing two 500gb drives and no 128gb drive.

I'm pretty pissed at myself for being so lazy and not thinking straight. I'm assuming that the computer is going to look for these EFI files that point to the correct bootloaders or something along those lines but effectively I've gone and deleted them.

I'm hoping someone here can shed some light on what happened and how to fix it?

---

### Ongoing notes 
- Since then I've booted from a live USB, installed rEFInd, and ran sudo bootctl install which has given me back my recovery boot at least so I no longer need my USB, which I guess is something.

- Seems to be that I either end up in the grub terminal or a initramfs terminal.

- I booted up on my live USB and generated the following report. Hopefully that helps http://sprunge.us/rZsOCu

---

### Solution

Feels like it's not much of an answer as it doesn't fix the problem directly but for completion here's how it's now all sorted.

Firstly, I did a fresh install of Pop_OS. That removed the grub problems and created that OS bootable.

Secondly, with windows, I created a usb for that so I could boot into. Then went into the advanced repair for the terminal and used `diskpart` to look at the situation. Initially no drives were showing up at all other than the usb that I was running off. I forgot that this was an issue due to my raid array being done via the motherboard and you have to load some drivers in to see all the drives. Following [the directions for that](https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/SocketAM4/TUF_GAMING_X570-PLUS_WI-FI/E14794_RAID_Configuration_Guide_EM_V4_WEB.pdf) which is obviously motherboard specific; I was able to view the drives in diskpart. I listed the disks, selected the one that looked like the right size, selected the volume that seemed appropriate, renamed the drive letter, and ran the command `bcdboot C:\windows /s V: /f UEFI` with the appropriate drive letters, which took some looking around.

After all that my Windows drive was recognised and I could boot into it and it was also appearing on my boot menu.",pop_os,1651275165.0
2533,comment,8,i6q9h90,,"On a UEFI install   Pop_os uses systemd-boot  and NOT GRUB.

I see many posts in this sub where people either just assume pop uses grub, or dont understand it does not, or they cant figure out how to add windows to their systemd-boot menus.

In short.

1. Pop Uses systemd boot on a UEFI setup. A legacy install can use grub.
2. You can add windows to the systemd-boot menus. (there is a guide out on that topic) There is no need to use grub for that ability.
3. You can use the UEFI boot menus to select what OS to boot. 
4. If you want a nicer looking Boot menu - then install `rEFInd` which can chainload systemd-boot or boot windows directly.
5. I have seen numerous posts where people break their system  boot files by trying to force grub on a Uefi Pop_OS install
6.  When dual booting - you want to use  the same mode for every OS. (uefi or legacy) Mixing modes can be problematic. with two drives you should still be able to boot either OS using the UEFI boot menus.


As for a Fix... No idea. :)   If you can still boot to the Pop_OS install, i would be lazy and just install rEFInd and reboot and use the rEFInd menu to see what OS's are shown, and use that. 

rEFInd - has the ability to scan the entire system (all EFI partitions, and all drives) and generate a menu of ALL bootable OS it finds. Even USB flash drives will show up if they are bootable.   Its an impressive tool.

First:

Second:
""sudo mv /usr/bin/add-apt-repository /

Third:
""sudo apt-get upgrade""

Then reboot and check Pop!\_Shop or rerun sudo apt-get update and upgrade to check.

2. Following the instructions of u/JAY0S on the comments:

2610,comment,1,i72d3yu,,"This is being caused by a bug in the repolib preinstallation script and a PR is open to get it fixed which should be released soon. In the meantime, if you are experiencing this issue you can workaround it by running the following commands:

    sudo apt update
    sudo unlink /usr/bin/add-apt-repository
    sudo unlink /usr/bin/apt-add-repository
    sudo dpkg --configure -a
    sudo apt install -f
    sudo apt full-upgrade

This issue should only be occurring on certain subsets of Pop installs, and will only occur if the `software-properties-common` package is removed prior to installing/upgrading/reinstalling the `python3-repolib` package. If you're concerned about hitting this issue before performing an upgrade, the following should ensure that you are good to go (without causing damage to your system if it would not have caused problems):

    if [[ `dpkg -s software-properties-common | grep 'Status'` = *'installed'* ]]; then echo Your system is not susceptible to the bug!; else sudo unlink /usr/bin/add-apt-repository; sudo unlink /usr/bin/apt-add-repository; echo Bug mitigated; fi

Simply copy-paste the entire command into a terminal and press enter to check/mitigate the issue. It will check whether your system has the trigger condition or not (missing `software-properties-common`) and then remove the offending files if so.",pop_os,1651519507.0

My installation procedure was: Receiving a brand new computer about two weeks ago, did a clean install of Pop!\_OS 21.10 where i did a little bit of custom partitioning (two partitions on my main drive, one for / and one for /home), and set up separate bulk storage HDD to automatically mount on boot.  All drives are brand new NVME drives (Samsung 980 pro for / and the /home partition, and a kingston 1TB for bulk storage).

Installed the Tuxedo software via their apt repository (drivers for keyboard backlight and a custom button to launch their fan speed app, etc [https://github.com/tuxedocomputers](https://github.com/tuxedocomputers) ). I believe they also provide their own blend of NVDIA stuff. So maybe that's the culprit, but seeing people having the same problem as me I don't know.

After that an upgrade to 22.04 via settings app.

Experiencing quit a few problems (especially audio related, and bluetooth not working nicely as it did with 21.10). Had a few random kernel panics trying audio stuff. MIDI seem to be a real nasty problem.

I'm glad I didn't upgraded my main audio production computer yet.

Either a full reinstall (should be options to preserve your /home), or apt remove nearly everything from the system `sudo apt remove gnome-*`, etc, and re-installing fresh clean versions from the updated 22.04 repo should do the trick.  The challenge with this approach is finding just *which* package is hanging up the upgrade.  `sudo apt remove dropbox` may be helpful judging from your logs.

Take a note of which applications (like Dropbox) you removed so you can add them back in once your upgrade completes.

2656,comment,3,i6p1ws8,,"Starting with Gnome 42, most apps (at least stock Gnome apps) now use GTK4, and thus only use the *libadwaita* theme (an enhanced version of Adwaita that is still being worked on for enhancements). Old apps, that use either GTK3 or GTK2, can still use a custom theme: look for Gnome Tweaks >>> Appearance >>> Legacy Applications.

My advice: get used to *libadwaita:* the apps look good, they will behave as intended and the integration with Qt, Flatpaks, etc is awesome. Finally it is possible to use different apps in a DE and have an unified look. It already has a light/dark variant, and hopefully it will support different accent colors soon (like Ubuntu does now).

If you cannot live without your custom theme for some reason, you can force each GTK4 app to use a theme by setting the environment variable GTK\_THEME, for instance:

    GTK_THEME=Pop-dark nautilus

New user here trying out Pop OS for the first time after 6 years on Ubuntu LTS releases.

Based on a couple day's usage, here's my thoughts:

* Installation went pretty well. I have a separate /home partition so I have kept that, configuring the partitions was straightforward enough, and install was fast.
* First impressions with the updated GNOME are positive and the extra pop\_os polish is nice.
* Happy to get away from snap-based Firefox on Ubuntu (prefer Pop's decision to use Flatpak)
* I experienced some bugs though:

1. gnome-terminal font seem broken. It [looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/xgHAr1X.png)
2. I installed xfce4-terminal, since that allows font selection in its settings, which solved that problem for me, but I still have a broken ZSH style (agnoster). I have the powerline fonts, but the prompt colours are totally wrong and don't match [this](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme).  (NB this used to work fine on Ubuntu)
3. Fonts are less good than Ubuntu defaults in general - not sure why they don't just keep Ubuntu's - but since the fonts are already installed, it's easy enough to change them.
4. \[minor\] The time was wrong by 1 hour: it had failed to apply DST. Weirdly, going back into settings and selecting a different location and then re-selecting the correct location fixed it.

I also have one criticism:

Pressing super brings up the launcher which lets you type to find. There is a separate screen to bring up workspace/windows. Why on earth aren't these on the same screen? There is enough space on the workspace screen to have a search box - as soon as you start typing the results could appear below. It would make a lot more sense to have these two screens combined. I'm surprised by such an obvious oversight, and is the one thing I'm not really happy with regarding the desktop experience.

Thanks for reading. Any pointers on fixing these issues, esp the terminal, appreciated!",pop_os,1651243312.0
2698,comment,1,i6obzwr,,"Probably something went wrong when you tried to install the powerline fonts. I do not use them, NerdFonts have a much more complete set of glyphs, probably this is what you want. But first I would revert anything you did to make stock fonts work, it should not be broken. And you can set a custom font in Gnome Terminal, one per each profile.

Finally, about the launcher, you can also easily go back to stock vanilla Gnome:

    sudo apt install gnome-session

Disable all extensions, pick Gnome in the cog wheel before you login, then enable only the extensions you want/need.",pop_os,1651245549.0

2747,post,1,uelfnx,Pop!_OS 22.04 - Gnome Freeze often when using SUPER (COSMIC extension disabled),"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I successfully upgraded to Pop!\_OS 22.04 and I noticed some issue with Gnome.

&#x200B;

First, I have Cosmic Extension disabled because I need my SUPER key to show the current launched app when I press it and also search program if I start typing text in that state (which sadly, this double function of SUPER doesn't exist with Cosmic, it's either but not both).

&#x200B;

Since the upgrade, I noticed slow down and sometime full freeze of Gnome but only when using the SUPER Key.

&#x200B;

The thing is: it's only Gnome who freeze, the rest of my computer work well (for example, if a video is running, the sound still is here).

I can't do an ALT+F2 and then ""r"" to restart it (but I have access to CTRL+SHIFT+F3 / 4 / 5 etc).

&#x200B;

Aside from an hard reset, I found that the command:

`killall -HUP gnome-shell`

solve the situation.

&#x200B;

I haven't had any issue before the upgrade so I wonder, does anyone else have also this issue? And if yes, did you solved it?

&#x200B;

Thank for the help!",pop_os,1651237317.0

2766,post,1,uek960,Windows and Pop issues,"So, I've ""upgraded"" to 22.04. Glad they brought back the dock-style interface

By ""upgraded"", I mean I may or may not have force shut down the computer in the middle of the update. So I brought out my usb drive and installed 22.04 fresh.

I've got Windows 10 dual-booting with Pop. My laptop is a slightly old (3 yr) dell laptop, with Windows preinstalled.

I've partitioned my drive and was careful not to format the windows drives. I'm still partially keeping with windows as some games and programs I use don't play nicely with wine (but 99% of the time I'm on Linux).

The reinstall went smoothly, but now I've got a few problems

1. My windows drive used to show up in Nautilus. It's not doing that right now

2. Windows isn't booting. No part of it. Just a ""no boot medium found"" error when I disable everything except for wbm in bios

Here's what I tried:

1. Using my USB to load the windows installer and repair using bootrec. Successfully found my windows install. Threw a ""the system cannot find the file specified"" when using any of the repair functions

2. Copying my windows boot files to systemd efi partition. Thought it might work since systemd-boot usually detects the windows files and creates the boot option. Still didn't show up in boot menu

3. Manually booting the .efi files from bios. Not working

I know this is about windows not working, and less to do with Pop, but I'm curious if the install/upgrade modifys any windows partitions

btw my files are still intact on the windows partition. Copying stuff off is a bit of a pain though, as I need to comb through all the directories and find important files. 

Did anyone else have issues with dual-booting windows and pop?

Also, I'm not trying to complain about their work, but to say that problably nobody has tested that resolution sounds strange, testing the UI on different resolutions seems like a very basic task you'd expect from a company that is developing and providing an OS to be used on hardware other than what they selling.",pop_os,1651233376.0

2822,post,10,uegfvz,How would one go about preventing audio crackling (DAC clicking) on Pop!_OS 22.04?,"This issue occurs whenever I start/stop playing audio. It appears immediately when starting, but when it came to stopping, it takes about 12 seconds to occur. According to system76’s [audio troubleshooting page](https://support.system76.com/articles/audio/#audio-crackling-or-hardware-clicking), this was due to PulseAudio putting my audio card to sleep too often. 

The solution they provided were these two commands:

    1. sudo sed -i 's/load-module module-suspend-on-idle/#load-module module-suspend-on-idle/' /etc/pulse/default.pa
    2. pulseaudio -k

This solution did work for me, but as PulseAudio has now been replaced by PipeWire in the latest LTS update, it’s now been outdated.

I’ve visited the Pop!_Chat for support, and the proposed solution was to: 

    1. Open the file ‘50-alsa-config.lua’ (sudo gedit /usr/share/wireplumber/main.lua.d/50-alsa-config.lua)
    2. Remove the two hyphens before ‘[""session.suspend-timeout-seconds""]’ (line 114)
    3. Change its value from 5 to 0 ([""session.suspend-timeout-seconds""] = 0)
    4. Save & reboot

The audio crackling was now gone, but this was because the proposed solution broke the audio system, as it prevented any audio from playing at all (w/ or w/o headphones). Additionally, the speaker icon for sound in the top-right drop-down menu was now gone. 

I’ve attempted to revert these changes by adjusting the ‘50-alsa-config.lua’ file back to its default settings, but this did not work. I had to refresh the OS to fix the audio being mute, but despite this refresh, the audio crackling still persisted (which is to be expected, as I did do a clean-wipe before updating to 22.04).

I’m open to any suggestions.",pop_os,1651216826.0

If I have nvidia graphics card and also integrated one but I only want to use integrated so I gain anything by installing nvidia version of ISO? I'm asking because I don't know how it's handled when nvidia version is not installed. Does the graphics get some drivers anyways and use some power? I had pop\_os some time ago and I installed nvidia version but I always kept integrated graphics on without ever needing to go for nvidia.

tldr:  What I'm really asking if there is a power consumption difference between choosing the hybrid with having only integrated turned on and the non-nvidia version ",pop_os,1651211996.0

The system76-power tool will allow you to switch to integrated graphics only and switch the discrete graphics off (`system76-power graphics power off`) completely.

Without the Nvidia driver or switching the Nvidia card off in the BIOS (not all BIOS allow that) the power state of the discrete graphics will be undefined - and most likely draw more power than the Nvidia driver in hybrid mode.",pop_os,1651225628.0

2846,comment,1,i6na2ch,,"For power consumption - installing TLP will make more of a difference than whether you're running the Nvidia card or not, and there's no point in not installing the drivers for your GPU as you can just boot into Integrated mode and the dGPU will stay off.

I don't normally use hybrid mode because I get screen tearing and glitches with it on my machine. I boot into Nvidia or Integrated. TLP is pretty much set it and forget it; that'll get you solid battery life without tweaking.

Edit: Also - you will probably have to do this anyway. I can't say for sure with Pop OS, but most Linux distros will notice you've got a dGPU. If you don't install the Nvidia drivers, you're gonna be running on Nouveau, the open source variant. You will have to choose integrated mode regardless if you want the best battery life.

I've never tried installing the Pop OS image sans Nvidia drivers so I can't say for sure how it works, but every other distro I've tried uses Nouveau automatically - and without the proprietary drivers, I usually didn't have the ability to switch to Integrated mode at all.

The game used to run without any issues on 21.10, but ever since I upgraded I experience frequent fits of lag and sound issues, as well as the controller acting wonky. This occurs regardless of what settings I change in-game, or when downgrading the Nvidia driver. This leads me to believe that whatever is causing it, has to do with Pop OS 22.04 itself.

So start the terminal and start logging with `sudo journalctl -fb --no-hostname` (f is so it keeps showing things in the log as they happen). Then open the game and use it normally until you run into problems. Quickly end the game and look back into the logs. You'll probably have to read back quite some stuff, but things are color coded. If something's yellow, keep an eye on that. If something is red, you should Google it and see if there's a fix. Even if it's not the cause of your problems it still says something's really broken and should be fixed. But it's not impossible that it might be not shown that obviously.

For some context, my harddisk that hosts POPOS is not encrypted.

When my computer rebooted, it autolaunches cryptsetup to try and find a disk with UUID=(bunch of nbrs). This will fail because my disk is not encrypted so the UUID that it is finding does not exist.
After a minute or so it gives up and launches busybox. 

blkid returns nothing
/dev directory does not contain /sda

When exiting busybox, I get this:
ALERT! UUID=... does not exist. Dropping to a shell!

I can open the systemd boot menu when I reboot and enter the recovery partition. However, I cannot refresh install as the recovery partition had been updated to 22.04 and the current OS version on the main disk is 21.10.

How do I fix this? Is there a way to disable cryptsetup on boot?

2983,post,6,ue4m9l,Fixing micro AND macro stuttering due to keybindings on mouse buttons,"When I updated to 22.04, it also updated Libmutter, and that's an issue for me because I have keyboard macro keybinds on my mouse buttons. I hope this summary is correct as I remember it; by default Mutter will cause a very noticeable stutter when pressing a keyboard key on one input device, and then on another. Like say, if you have the \\ key bound to a thumb button on your mouse (like I do). and then you press the w key on your keyboard, suddenly you will get a massive hitch. And it happens every time you press one and then the other. So if you're holding down w and then keep pressing the thumb button, every time there will be a big fat stutterbomb.  


This by itself is a non-trivial issue for me, but for whatever reason mutter will sometimes also cause games to not render at the framerate they say they are. I can be getting 130 on the FPS counter, but it will look and feel like 45. I don't know why these two things are connected for my machine, but strangely (and thankfully), both are able to be fixed with a pretty simple but tedious bit of source code editing.

[https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/1858#note\_818548](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/1858#note_818548) Follow these instructions if you have similar issues. There appears to be a caveat for those using different keyboard layouts for whatever reason, but for qwerty users I don't think there's much of a downside and I'm glad this information is available because these issues are enough to drive me bonkers.

I will upload the fixed libmutter version I compiled myself, which should be fine, you'll just need to open a terminal to the directory with that package and execute the install command `sudo dpkg -i [package name]` (and then restart gnome-shell). But I understand trusting an executable uploaded by a stranger online is not everyones's idea of a good time. Plus, this is only applicable for THIS version of mutter, and installing an older package may cause issues in future mutter revisions.

use arch i know it sounds scary installing a distro from terminal but with arch everything is so fast because its a completely new slate and you get a user-friendly install script just run ""archinstall"" when you enter the install terminal and it'll do everything for u and you just choose what you want. manjaro also doesnt game well for some reason but maybe thats just me",pop_os,1651199018.0

3062,post,3,ue35xz,DUALBOOT - Harddrive Partitions for Pop OS,"While searching around I haven't found a clear answer to how you should partition the hard drive while doing a clean install of Pop OS. Since the release of 22.04 I wanted to make a clean install and my guess is some want to do that as well. So why not help each other make it easy?   


The four main partitions for a custom install would be:  

/boot       2046MB  

/home     4096MB  

/               2048MB(swap)  

/root       (remaining disk space)

From my understanding, this is what you actually need, but since I've made a couple of clean installs and made some light research I want to point out that /home directory should be of greater size. Some also mention that you would manage with 2 partitions, but I do not know if that is a good solution. The aim for this install is to work alongside windows or any other OS on the same storage unit a.k.a. dualbooting. A working OS where you do not run out of space when installing from the terminal or Pop Shop.

As of now, on my 1 TB SSD, I would partion like this:  

/boot       2GB  

/home     20GB  

/               2GB(swap)  

/root       200GB

The remaining storage would be for windows, a partition for storage on both or mulitple OS would be preferable but I'm not sure how to make a working one.

I will update the thread for solutions and alternatives so feel free to discuss how you would do it and why.",pop_os,1651174384.0
3063,comment,2,i6ks0iv,,"At one time I used to worry about setting up a separate /home partition, but now I usually just take the defaults of /boot/iso (\~500mb) and / (remaining space) on my 512gb nvme boot ssd.  On a separate 1tb sata ssd I set that up as /data.  Don't really worry too much about a swap partition as I have 32gb ram and am on a desktop machine, although it appears that Pop OS made me a 4gb swap partition.  When I was running Manjaro it skipped creating one altogether.  If it was a laptop, I'd make swap ram size+2gb to allow for suspend to disk.",pop_os,1651176626.0

For example. Your list shows a /boot/ partition which is only needed in a few special cases, and does not mention an EFI partition which is REQUIRED for booting a UEFI system.

also  '/' is the 'root' partition,  /root/ is the root users home.  Swap has no mountpoint, and you can use a swap file if you wanted.

You also dont mention/show  anything about whatever other OS you are 'dual booting' with.

Some Distros use (or can use)  /boot/ as their EFI partition.

3077,post,11,ue25rk,[Kinda Feedback] My strange experience with 22.04 so far,"I upgraded to 22.04 from 21.10 this morning, now it's 8pm so I have about a day of experience with it.I honestly think that where system76 takes the OS is very nice, and it's gonna get more and more popular amongst non techy people too, at least that's what I hope to happen.

But there are some things I've experienced since upgrading to 22.04, notably **a longer boot tim**e *(honestly could be because of my HDD dying)*, **laggy applications**, and a **bit of a performance loss** in general, but performance gain in gaming, if that even makes sense.

Since I upgraded, some of my apps that I use everyday, have became a bit weird, like the text messenger Viber, it sometimes freezes up after sending a message, or randomly gains focus when getting notification from it *(no, it doesn't have a setting for this, I checked)*, which didn't happen before the update. Weirdly enough Viber doesn't get the same focus bug on cinnamon, which I use on my desktop pc. I use pop gnome on my laptop and there, on one screen it's perfectly usable, and very fluent to work with, but it's a bit more buggy so far than cinnamon for me. **BUT** I'm looking forward the Rust Cosmic desktop that might be available this summer as I've read the news, I've been really hyped about that since it got announced.I tried to move back to pop gnome on my desktop as well, but when I played games in fullscreen they sometimes flickered. It might have been because of the sensitivity being high and maybe it mistakenly thought I clicked out of the window for a second or something, I don't know the technical details yet, but I plan on experimenting a bit more with it, but for now I switched back to cinnamon.

Other than that, I had to reinstall some applications, due to the upgrade. I don't know for sure why it happened, but I had to reinstall a few games that just refused to work after the update, like League of Legends and Minecraft, and a few applications, that seemed to break after the update too. The cause of them not working I do not know, but every time I opened them, they just refused to open, even tho they were shown running in the system monitor. But once reinstalled, they work like a charm, just like before the update.

Even though in general I feel like I lost performance, in gaming however I feel like I gained performance and  a bit latency reduction, probably thanks to the pop-scheduler. Before the update, I felt sometimes that I had a bit of input lag, or at least it wasn't as quick as I actually was, so to say.But now in games I don't have that feeling anymore and it's nice to have a near flawless experience!

The fresher looking pop shop is also very nice and clean, and even tho I prefer to install things in the terminal, I appreciate that they put an effort into making things like that as user friendly as they can be.

&#x200B;

Overall I'm pretty pleased with the new release! I kinda expected color changing like what ubuntu implemented, but I'm not surprised it haven't made it in.Other than the very few, minor issues I've mentioned above, which I think I'll find a fix eventually, I can only recommend 22.04!

&#x200B;

I'd also like to know how others handle the update, and how their system react, adapt to it, so feel free to share it!Thanks for reading!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dragging around windows lags them around instead of smoothly dragging them.

Maximizing some of them freezes them for about 2 seconds and displays the free floating one stretched/ repeated across where they should be maximized.

You know how around your profile picture in discord, there is a green line which goes on or off when you stop/start talking? That freezes everything for about half a second to a second when going on or off.

When starting my pc, I cannot use the mouse and keyboard for about 5-10 seconds.

I just switched my desktop to Wayland, where I had to install Inkscape and HandBrake as flatpaks to even be able to run them, so obviously I'm interested how fast they would be able to handle a Converible with pen input. I do prefer the apt system for reasons, but if I have the choice of course I'd rather have an application run as flatpak than as Canonicals ridiculous snap. But if it wouldn't work in a decent manor I'd still have to stick to X11 which I would like to pretend at all costs. After all, all work invested into a system that's actually functional would be wasted if nobody would use it.",pop_os,1651182106.0

Also, consider copying your Windows bootloader into Pop!\_OS's EFI partition and using that when booting into Windows. It'll limit Windows' autonomy and hence the damage it can do to your setup. It'll also mean that you can always boot from Pop!\_OS's EFI, even if you want to use Windows.

If your systemd-boot menu isn't showing on boot (when booting from the Linux EFI), then I think you need to spam the spacebar to make it show.

Probably not the best option for network security, but downgrading to OpenSSL1.1.1 fixed the issue. And it will work in a pinch for finals week.

I did a manual downgrade by downloading the OpenSSL source code for 1.1.1 [here](https://www.openssl.org/source/)

I compiled it, renamed the defauklt openssl binary, and put the 1.1.1 version it its place. Now I can connect to PEAP/enterprise wifi without issue. 

This is likely not the best method because it uses an old version of OpenSSL, so you lose some new security features. If anyone has a way to only use the old version for wifi that would be greatly appreciated.

Looking around, other distributions upgrading to OpenSSL 3.0 (including Fedora 36 and RedHat 9) are also facing this issue:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2072070

The crux of the issue is that OpenSSL is once againg tightening requirements and thus removing support for ""legacy"" encryption schemes. In theory this is a good thing as it reduces the chances of say MITM attacks for older methods.  Unfortunately, many real world networks rely on these legacy schemes and so we get people at universities being able to connect to the WiFi.

anyone have any clue on how to get my jack setup working again?

edit / solution: 

so the d-bus errors were a complete red herring. i did the following to get it working which wasn't much.

1. upgrade (simple enough)
2. enable the ""Pro"" config profile for my interface(s) (e.g. use `pavucontrol` ) which essentially allows for inputs/outputs to be their own thing and not ""bundled"" together.
3. now this was the tricky part...so all of the input / output names changed (duh), but! the naming of them uses `0` indexing, so keep that in mind. 
4. another bit that kept screwing with me was that when you change the inputs / outputs in bitwig, you have to choose a new input/output before you select the new one. i took a lil' view of it [here](https://imgur.com/a/xXqdmwB)

i went ahead and removed all my inputs / outputs in the settings and recreated them as some of my outputs (whose names correlated with some of my inputs) kept failing to provide sound.",pop_os,1651113634.0

- the settings for `qjackctl` are stored here `~/.config/rncbc.org/QjackCtl.conf`
- the JACK settings persisted from the d-bus object, `~/.config/jack/conf.xml`, so yeah, anytime JACK runs this is an indication of what settings were last run and is constantly overwritten by whatever is start/configuring JACK.
- logs for `jackdbus`;  `~/.log/jack/jackdbus.log`
- some other settings used by `jackd`, `/usr/share/jackd/audio.conf`, which i believe is responsible for JACK permissions as per https://jackaudio.org/faq/linux_rt_config.html, but i'm assuming it's in a diff location because when i refer to `jackd` i really mean `jackd2` . . . i think ?

**Solution for L2TP VPN (thank you** u/log2x_johnshi )

`sudo apt remove --purge xl2tpd`

`wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/x/xl2tpd/xl2tpd_1.3.12-1.1_amd64.deb`

`sudo dpkg -i xl2tpd\_1.3.12-1.1\_amd64.deb`

`sudo apt install network-manager-l2tp network-manager-l2tp-gnome`

`sudo reboot`

1. Export your vpn connection (replace ""MyVPN"" with the actual name of your VPN):  
`nmcli c export ""MyVPN"" > ""~/MyVPN.ovpn""`
2. Edit the exported file and add these 2 lines  
`tls-cipher ""DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=0""remote-cert-tls server`
3. Re-import the VPN in the GUI (you might have to re-enter your credentials afterwards)  
`nmcli c import type openvpn file ""MyVPN.ovpn""`

I just updated to 22.04, and I love it, many small annoyances are now fixed (like Bluetooth headset issues) but for a reason I can't understand, the L2TP VPN refuses to work...Other types of VPN work fine.

I worked on monday on 21.10 and stopped working after 22.04 update...

3485,post,1,udgdop,Being put into emergency mode after the update.,"I updated to the new 22.04. It all went smoothly and everything but there were little things wrong. Like my brave browser flat out wouldn't work even though chrome was working fine. All my gnome extensions and settings for them were all gone. 

I was working at the time and couldn't be bothered with the hassle so I just loaded up timeshift and restored to the previous days snapshot. Once that was done I was prompted with the following message:
    
    Welcome to emergency mode! After logging in, type ""journalctl -xb"" to view system logs, ""systemctl reboot"" to reboot, ""systemctl default"" or ^D to try again to boot into dafault mode. Press Enter for maintenance (or press control-D to continue):     

Try a reboot on the off chance and still the same message. Rebooted again but this time in the grub menu I just loaded up the most recent old kernel and everything booted fine. I'm back in 21.10 for now.

So I would assume that I have a kernel issue then if I can boot up fine with 1 kernel but not the other?

However, [this stackoverflow question responses](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/347808/ubuntu-gives-message-welcome-to-emergency-mode/347840) seem to think it would be some form of data corruption?

Also the bigger size is a precautionary measurement (probably taken by Ubuntu and maybe even others), especially when you want to have dual boot. MS recommends at least 100 MB for Windows, having at least the same for Linux does make sense. In fact recommendations are already 250-300 MB for interoperability.

Do not resize the first ESP partition, instead create a separated one for Pop and use the EFI boot menu or systemd-boot as boot manager (it should also list other OSes on the same disk).

I've seen people reference a PipeWire-ALSA package on Arch-based distros that can route anything calling the ALSA API to PipeWire, but it doesn't look like that package exists for Pop/Ubuntu.

Is there a way around this? Can I install Pulseaudio side-by-side with PipeWire and still have everything work? Or do I need to revert back to Pulseaudio for the time being?

Always avoid using PPAs or third party repositories that install system files (drivers, libraries, etc), specially if you are new to Linux. If it just installs an app, it is usually safe.

If you cannot access the BIOS boot menu for some reason (some BIOS will freeze when trying to boot the OS or when entering the setup, but will display the boot menu), then you will need to reset the BIOS somehow, then configure it properly but do not add the Pop boot entry. If you can access the boot menu, then you can either boot the Live ISO or Windoze, and use something like EasyUEFI or `efibootmgr` to remove the Pop boot entry. If the BIOS has a CSM mode, you should disable it (usually it is buggy) but then you will have to fix the Windoze installation (search online for more info). Disabling Fast Boot may help too, if the BIOS has this option. As always, when dual booting Windoze, make sure Fast Startup is disable as well.

If the BIOS only boots in Legacy mode (no EFI), then your only hope will be a BIOS upgrade. If it boots in EFI mode then you can try to use rEFInd as boot manager, it is usually more compatible, and then you can use it to chain load Pop's **systemd-bootx64.efi** (do not boot the kernels directly).",pop_os,1651088921.0

3671,comment,2,i6gcdya,,"The benefit for the end user is quite simple: X11 will not get any real updates anymore. The only way to get it to handle modern techniques like HDR or even touchscreens is only through very hacky tricks often circumventing X altogether and it has been that way for decades. That is no useable base for any future features. Also Wayland is already much better when it comes to scaling in multi-monotor setups with different monitors.

Of course, it takes time to make everything work perfectly. Wayland is completely redone from scratch, so not only does it have to decide how existing features should be implemented to have a future-proof base, but also has to figure out how to implement modern features like HDR and color management, which themselves are features very complicated to implement. The biggest problem at the time is that there is nothing like the central X server that's being used independent of the DE. The DEs have to implement a Wayland compositor themselves, which means gradually reworking a lot of stuff to be able to handle Wayland without breaking X sessions and while being able to run as many X11 apps as possible through XWayland if they aren't updated or won't be updated.

That being said, accept on NVIDIA systems and in terms of GNOME, wayland is already in a very good place. I have only encountered major issues with the .deb versions of Inkscape and Handbrake which both refuse to run, but that can be solved by installing them as flatpaks. Also at the moment OBS for some reason doesn't offer screen capture through Pipewire even though it did on 21.10. Everything else I have just works. Most natively on wayland, some only through XWayland. Sure, you can force some QT Apps to use Wayland too, but for most of them the dev has a good reason not to set that as default just yet.

So while Wayland of course is still a work in progress, it's the only choice for the future and in many places for the presence. X11 doesn't even have a concept of multi touch, Wayland just has it backed right in. So if you want to do anything beyond low DPI SDR screens, Wayland is already the way to go, even when it's not fully there yet.",pop_os,1651094784.0

3690,comment,2,i6l94b5,,"Yes, it is an implementation problem. But that also makes it a problem for end users. HDR basically only work through capture cards or maybe some selected hardware. Color management is not feasible for private end users on  X11 afaik (if it's even possible at all). To be honest, at the moment that's more than Wayland can offer, since Collabora is still working on that. But considering the multi monitor setup, X can only handle the basic use cases and will probably never be able to handle anything else. If you have a high DPI monitor and a low DPI monitor, you pretty much have no other choice than to use Wayland to get a decent result.

I'm not sure how modern touch support looks on X, but probably it's like every modern feature on X. It's a hit or miss situation. You'll have probably more luck with Wayland with these use cases.

But like I said, if it's worth using Wayland is up to your use case. If you think something isn't up to what it's supposed to be compared to other OS's it doesn't hurt to try out Wayland as long as you don't use Nvidia GPUs. Even Debian, a very conservative distribution defaults to waylans. So while there is a chance that you rely on a program that can't run on wayland or on XWayland, the chance of that happening is lower with every update. So if you don't use NVIDIA GPUs and don't happen to usea program that just can't run in Wayland, I'd say there's simply no real reason to not give Wayland at least a try. Even though either Canonical or System76 wasn't capable of making a package a dependency that's needed by OBS and Chrome (at least) to handle screen sharing with wayland.",pop_os,1651183583.0

3692,comment,1,i6lc399,,"The problem is that Wayland requires severe patches and changes to be usable in a lot of cases. As you said yourself you're already removing approximately 80% of your end-users with it's bad nVidia support.

HDR is such a niche feature and is usually solved on the monitor. If you're saying but don't you want to enjoy HDR Video content on your desktop? In a majority of cases people that consume HDR content will usually have a home theater setup for that use case and not use their desktop. Now if you are someone that required HDR for professional reasons you probably wouldn't be running Linux first of all. Instead you would most likely gravitate towards the OSX platform.

My problem with the Wayland is that they focus on stuff that's not important for the end-user, things like no tearing (We already had solutions for that since forever with V-sync) but no Wayland decides to be special and enforce it on it's user no matter their use case.

This is a feature that automatically kills the compositor for any gamer out there. For example in games like Osu a difference of 10ms is such a major difference that can lead to a difference between a rank #10 play and a rank #10,000 play. In games like that you're playing in timing windows of +/- 10ms. If you introduce ANY delay, it is noticeable.

The absolute garbage support for global hotkeys automatically kills the compositor for anyone involved with professional streaming as controlling scenes, starting programs and general control scheme becomes unusable.

Also I think a mixture of different DPI monitors is extremely rare and uncommon so I don't think it's really much of benefit to even be worth mentioning but that's just my opinion. In the end I think that Wayland is far from stable and developed enough to serve the average user and in the end X11 is simply the better option.",pop_os,1651184919.0

Saying HDR is a niche use case and then complaining about the niche use case of streamers - I hope you see your bigotry.

I can connect to all of my other wireless networks - including the guest network on my campus but eduroam fails authentication.

This appears to be due to a bug introduced in the upgrade of the open ssl handling ( https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/+bug/1963834) and they have labeled it `Won't Fix` as it was an intentional security patch. 

There is apparently a workaround that I hope to try today -

Hello!

I've been using Pop OS for 6 months and I was perfectly happy with version 21.10, using a 49"" monitor on my Zephyrus G14.

Yesterday I updated PopOS to v22.04 .

Now I actually no longer have any sound drivers installed and PulseAudio is completely broken, as you can see in this hardware report:

[https://linux-hardware.org/?probe=863612cc05](https://linux-hardware.org/?probe=863612cc05)

I have as audio output: ""dummy output"".

I followed all instructions of the official audio guide from System76 to no avail:

[https://support.system76.com/articles/audio/](https://support.system76.com/articles/audio/)

If I try :

    systemctl --user restart pulseaudio 

I get:

    Failed to restart pulseaudio.service: Unit pulseaudio.service is masked.

This remains even after entering the unmasking command.

If I try:

    pulseaudio -k 

I get:

    Command 'pulseaudio' not found, but can be installed with:
    sudo apt install pulseaudio

Then this is the terminal message I get when I try to reinstall pulseaudio or with command sudo

    apt install --reinstall alsa-base alsa-utils pulseaudio linux-sound-base libasound2

I tried to update from 21.10 to 22.04 and I broke it, for some reasons (not relevant here) it stopped midway and broke systemd...

I flashed a 20.04 ISO and reinstalled the boot partition. It asked me to create a new user, which I did.

After the refresh install, I noticed that : 

1- I still have timeshift snapshots of system files from 1/2 weeks ago

2- My previous home folder is inside the new one, doing something like this : Computer/home(new)/home(old)/

I didn't try to upgrade to 22.04 and didn't find a way to upgrade specfically to 21.04/21.10 yet and I'm not sure about what to do in order to ""restore"" my previous user back. 

Just dragging the old user and deleting the new is enough ? (or some file systems need changes ?)

I also tried to restore the timeshift snapshot but failed, probably because it was not the same version. If I upgrade to 22.04, is the snapshot still usefull ?

I'm looking for advices about what the first step would be.

Grossssssssss

In the old system you could take a screenshot with left hand on
`alt+shift+PrintScrn` and select an area. As soon as you let go
of the mouse a file was automatically created in
`~/Pictures`. The new system requires that I navigate to the
correct monitor and click a tiny button?! It's nice that the new
system only requires pressing `PrintScrn` to begin the screen
shot capture process... but the extra click on a button is a
PAIN. Ugh.

I wish the new system were made so that pressing `PrintScrn` again
while in the area selection process was equivalent to clicking the
tiny button. And no, taking my hand off the mouse to press `Enter` is
NOT a better solution.

    - Take a screenshot after the specified number of seconds:
    gnome-screenshot --delay 5

    - Launch the GNOME Screenshot GUI:

3888,post,3,ucxz9l,Desktop freezing after 22.04 update,"Hi guys,

Looking for some help to fix an issue I'm experiencing.

Yesterday I've updated to 22.04 (from 21.10).

I'm on a old-ish Dell desktop, with an Intel i7-4790 (8) @ 4.000GHz and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti.

The update was super smooth, no error-message or issues. All good.

Yesterday evening, a few hours after the udpate, my desktop froze completely (impossible to access terminals with ctrl+alt+f1 f2 f3 etc...). This morning I had the same thing happening. The system is totally fine after forced rebooting with the power button. In two years using Pop it almost never happened, that's why I'm pretty sure it's related to the upgrade.

I've tried having a look in journalctl, but I'm a bit overwhelmed, and not sure what I should be looking for.

So I was wondering if anyone is having the same issue after upgrading; if there's some other key combo to at least try to restart cleanly the frozen desktop; and if you can point me in the right direction for further investigations.

Thanks!

Edit: had another instance of the desktop freezing. After running journalctl I'm noticing the same error that I did notice already this morning.

Looks similar to this one: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-session/+bug/1968907](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-session/+bug/1968907)

Edit: it has now been 3 days since the last time the desktop froze. I'm still seeing a few errors running 

*journalctl -p err*

that I don't think I was seeing before the update, especially this one: 

 *gnome-session-binary\[1970\]: GLib-GIO-CRITICAL: g\_bus\_get\_sync: assertion 'error == NULL || \*error == NULL' failed*

but as long as the desktop is responsive and does not freeze I can live with that.

So if you do stuff like that you either

- upgrade anyway and pray (didn't work, obviously)

You will have to install all packages (not flatpaks, since they are installed in the user directory by default - at least on Pop) but all your personal settings will still be there (as will your data).

I'd still like to have a backup ready in these cases, but the refresh is the better option for systems that are heavily modified like yours. The upgrader is not really meant for these cases.",pop_os,1651070794.0

3935,post,7,ucv9es,Issues with pipewire and DaVinci Resolve after 22.04 upgrade (no audio),"I've encountered the same issue as described in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/davinciresolve/comments/ucrwgm/audio_output_issues_on_linux_using_pipewire/) after upgrading my system. DaVinci Resolve (both 17 and 18 beta) and pipewire don't seem to notice one another, and running `pw-top` shows no new line made for Resolve when starting it up and trying to play audio. The waveforms appear in Resolve, but no sound. In the Audio I/O section of Resolve's preferences, only System Audio is available to select as the I/O Engine, and manually trying every available speaker (all of them just named ""ALSA"") yields nothing. Recreating the audio busses yields nothing.

I saw updates for the pipewire system today and thought that may fix the issue, though it hasn't. It's possible [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/comments/ubvln6/next_update_in_2204_will_enabled_jack_audio/) may fix it, unless that was already part of the system updates released today? I'm posting this here just in case it's something on PopOS' end. On 21.10 I had pipewire manually installed and Resolve's audio worked fine, though reinstalling it manually on 22.04 seems to break apt stuff when trying anything with the pipewire PPA \^\^'.

~~I'm also using an AMD gpu with Resolve which required~~ [~~this workaround~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/comments/rjdfbq/my_amdgpupro_success_story_on_pop_os_2110_opencl/) ~~to get working, so that may be related to this issue.~~ I will ask the other user what their gpu is just in case.EDIT: The other user is running an Nvidia card, so it's likely nothing to do with my gpu.

Thank you for any ideas for solving this issue!

EDIT: SOLUTION  
tl;dr: running `sudo ln -s /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/99-pipewire-default.conf /etc/alsa/conf.d/` and then `systemctl restart --user pipewire` should get DaVinci Resolve audio working as it normally would with pipewire.",pop_os,1651033775.0

If mint could properly recognise my Laptop's weird graphics setup, I'd never have switched off it to Pop. Even Ubuntu doesn't properly hand the integrated/dedicated Nvidia AMD jank (Asus Tuf FX505DT).

Pop? Pop just had it handled out of the box.

I think Pop is doing things in that department that I'm not seeing any other distro doing right now, and its a damn shame. 

Also, I hate how Ubuntu defaults to the Nouveau drivers, and has this weird growing obsession with snap over apt.

3974,comment,1,i6dlgko,,"The semi-tiling window manager. And that the DE can be driven by the keyboard.

I used to use i3 (regolith) and switch between the two, because Cosmic is not quite as powerful as i3 with respect to the tiling. But then Cosmic has the better GNOME integration. And it has better mouse support (anathema to some in the tiling WM world, but nice to have if you are on the mouse already and need to move a window) - it's about being efficient, after all.

Apart from that the Nvidia integration is nice, but Mint has that as well and while it's not installed during install (or on the boot image) it will be offered during the on-boarding in Mint. So it's a good thing to have it, but not a deal-breaker.

The power/hybrid graphics management is a bit better, I think, in Pop\_OS!, but I don't have measurements for that.

I recommend both to colleagues and students, dependent on what they prefer. With them I stick to LTS, so the faster update cycle of Pop\_OS! is not a positive in that case.

My wife prefers Mint, I prefer Pop\_OS!.

It's mostly DE, choose what you like. There is a better integration of some developer tools in Pop\_OS!, but it's really no problem to install those in Mint.

I think Pop\_OS! is a little bit less ""discoverable"", since some functionality is more easily accessed by a keyboard shortcut, rather than a menu. But on the other hand, that fits my DE paradigm, so I like that.

In general I have the feeling that Pop\_OS! is developed by power users, for power users, without leaving beginners at the wayside (unlike, e.g., i3 - I could boot into my other session and hand the machine off and be quite certain that they could not even find the launch menu).",pop_os,1651048369.0

They make sure the systems use Linux compatible components and they make coreboot for the systems, and they improve and/or optimize the kernel to support the hardware they deliver under their brand. System76 is an awesome contributor to Linux in general. I have had problems with my laptop hardware in and out of warranty though, namely with the speakers. It’s not MacBook quality and I would certainly like them to make more premium high end mediaphile stuff like apple. Overall very happy with the system I bought from them.

4006,post,6,ucuaq4,22.04 isn't cutting it for me,"Hey guys, I am debating whether to keep the new version installed or go back to 20.04 LTS. I miss pressing the super key and having the workspace, launcher, and window selector all in one place. The steps look too convoluted for me to bother adding it back to 22.04. Are there any important features that I would be missing out on by just re-installing the old version?

&#x200B;

Optional sob story: I had 20.04 for about a week and I fell in love with the UI. It's so much better than stock Ubuntu. Then I saw that the new versions have gesture navigation and a sick looking dock. Naturally I believed I had nothing to lose, so I clicked the update button. It proceeded to corrupt all the files in my 20.04 partitions. This may be because I'm dual-booting with windows, but I still feel bummed that I lost about a weeks worth of customization and downloaded programs.

So I decided to go all-in: I flashed the new ISO, installed it, and... was severely disappointed. The gesture navigation is great - but all the new menus were 3 steps backwards. I got so used to using the super key that now the dock feels like it's just in the way. The gestures aren't even customizable as far as I can tell. The cherry on top is that the app menu is horrible to navigate, compared to 20.04. I feel like I got scammed by the hype, if you know what I mean.

No offense to the developers. This is light years ahead of any other distro, IMO. I just want to tell you guys my experience, and I am genuinely curious as to what you think as well.",pop_os,1651030365.0

4134,post,2,ucnijf,PSA: Disable Fast Startup and Hibernation in Windows,"Since this is becoming a theme, here's a quick PSA. 


... 


TL;DR:



In Windows 10:


Windows+X > Power Options > “Choose what the power buttons do.” >  “Change settings that are currently unavailable” > uncheck Fast Startup and Hibernation > Shut Down - **not ""restart""** > Boot into Linux 


If Fast Startup option is missing: Windows+X > Command Prompt (Admin) > type ""powercfg /hibernate on"" without quotes > run through the steps again and it will appear. Be sure to ""Shut Down."" 


Windows 11:


Control Panel > Hardware & Sound > Power Options > follow above steps. 



Source: https://www.howtogeek.com/243901/the-pros-and-cons-of-windows-10s-fast-startup-mode/

... 



Because Windows expects to be the only OS on the system, it doesn't truly *shut down* when Fast Startup and Hibernation are enabled. They are enabled by default. Windows will lock down the hardware, including but not limited to the **disk**, **graphics**, **WiFi**, **Bluetooth**, **keyboard** and **mouse** when you restart, so it can save a couple seconds at boot time. 


**It doesn't matter if Windows is on the same drive as Linux, if Windows touched your computer and these settings were on, Linux will struggle to access basic hardware.**


Perhaps more obviously, os-prober won't work because Linux is locked out of **any drives that were in use by Windows prior to shutting down**. Trying to install Linux will be unsuccessful, and if you try to force it, you can damage your Windows installation. 



Normal Linux troubleshooting won't help. There are literally dozens of these posts every week where people can't figure out why their graphics / wifi / bluetooth / keyboard etc etc work fine in Windows but are broken / wonky in Linux, *even when Windows is on a completely different disk* and they've followed advice from expert Linux users. That's because it's a Windows issue, not a Linux issue. 



**ADDITIONALLY**, Secure Boot may need to be disabled or otherwise addressed in BIOS. Windows is usually registered as the only valid OS, so trying to add a new OS will be seen as a potential hijack. Windows 11 takes this even further by requiring mandatory Trusted Platform Module (TPM) with the installation. This links your hardware (BIOS) with your specific Windows installation. If you need to use Windows 11, then you may need to research how to disable this. Personally, I will just stick to Windows 10 LTSC.

You could start the programs from shell. Sure, the problem would still exist, but it would show you some logs. Also concerning the Extensions application, I would recommend everybody to just use the Flatpak ""Extension Manager"".

This is very stupid, imo. It should just determine the default option but it should not disable possibility to opt in for Wayland as a user.

Check the \[Xanmod\] repo see if it says jammy, I think it should match with -

`lsb_release -a`

\[Preventing pop\_os from installing kernels:\]

As a guess you would need to use `aptitude` or `apt-mark` to set the new generic kernel ""hold"", mark the old one remove, run `apt autoremove --purge` for the old kernel,

Create new symlinks `vmlinuz` and `initrd.img`

`sudo find /boot -type l -ls`

Once you fix the symlinks  run -

`sudo kernelstub`  \# To copy the files \[in /boot\] to `/boot/efi/`

Reboot, It should boot to the generic by default.

4213,comment,1,i6etfs1,,"I just built a gaming rig with Pop_OS in mind. I’d been using it to game, but didn’t play Online Multiplayer so it worked great for _most_ games. You have to use a compatibility tool called Proton in Linux if you want to play games on Steam, I haven’t tried it with Epic. This means before you buy a game you’ll want to check www.protondb.com for compatibility. This worked great for me pre-build.

I bought Lian Li AL120 UniFans. I got two 3-packs of these fans, each pack comes with a controller. Fans plug into controller, controller plugs into RGB, and Fan headers on Mobo. The wire for the fan header only has one wire but a four pin connector. More on that later. 

In Linux you can use Wine to run Windows programs, but it’s not perfect. So I always planned to use that to install fan controller software. RGB would be controlled using OpenRGB. I used their supported software list to buy any RGB components. The AL120s vary slightly from the SL120s and OpenRGB were nearly at a solution last I checked, so I figured I’d wait it out for RGB or use Wine.

I built the computer (which is also a full AMD System, except GPU) and installed the L-Connect and NZXT Cam software using Wine, fired it up, and the apps were borked. L-Connect told me it couldn’t detect any their components, and would be un-closable. NZXT Cam would load fine, but anything hardware related was undetectable. At least I could close the app though. Ended up logging out/in to kill L-Connect since I was too lazy to use `htop` and find the offending PID.

So I went looking for fan control software in Linux and `fancontrol` kept popping up, so installed it, configured it, and ran Handbrake for encoding—I’m backing up my movie collection. My temps went well over 100° C without a abatement! I quickly shut down handbrake, and spent the next day or two trying to configure it, running handbrake, temps too high, reconfigure, etc.

I did some Googling and found that since the [fan header plug for my controller had one wire](https://www.reddit.com/r/lianli/comments/rhzmqd/comment/hov270m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), it was [missing the wires for power and the wire that sends data](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/whats-the-difference-between-3-pin-fans-and-4-pin-pwm-fans.3209936/post-19785479) to the motherboard that the fans are spinning. The only one it had was the one that reported the current RPM. (Slightly) better than nothing, but made me think it was detected but not controllable. Really `fancontrol` could not detect any fans, since the RPMs never changed while it was testing the fans, it knew they were there and running, but could not affect them. Major bummer. 

Hell, I even downloaded `fancontrol-gui` and turned each fan sensor up to 100% one by one to see if I could do it manually to no effect. The only one that worked, I’m betting was the AIO water pump but not any fans—PWM powered. Even though I had configured fan curves set in my BIOS my computer would still jump well over 100° C after about 5 minutes of running Handbrake. 

I was done with all the troubleshooting and just wanted something that worked.

I don’t just use my PC for gaming, I’m a casual gamer. I am a software developer and do a lot of CPU intensive things, so I need the CPU to be under strain and stay at reasonable temps for handbrake, compiling code, computing, etc. 

So I broke, after being very happy with Linux and a huge fan of Pop_OS and System76, and bought a windows license. It was a royal pain in my ass to make a Windows bootable USB from Linux. Then my extra drive wasn’t formatted properly. It took three attempts at installing it.

I just couldn’t risk my new computer; I knew the cooling software would run in Windows.

But that said, if you have PWM powered fans (your fans aren’t powered over SATA) and don’t play Online Multiplayer (EAC will get you in Linux) then I think you’d benefit from Linux. I personally think Linux is the future of gaming, and Linux is endlessly customizable. I only get into trouble when I’m doing things I shouldn’t so it’s very stable. I miss it…",pop_os,1651073193.0

 Yes, I had to use an old kernel previously because I messed up some config files of my graphic card.

It was while trying to enable the manual config of fans, because they do not run above around 4k rpm automatically -> I'd have to boot into windows, set the rpm to a fixed value there, then go back on Pop for my gaming, then back to windows again to set them back to auto.

Before trying any of the following, take a look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/comments/ucge6e/upgrade_help_thread/). It looks like useful information, and it's from a person with much more experience than I.

But if what you need isn't covered there, read on.

**What Happened?**

My computer appeared to upgrade without a problem. It took a few minutes for me to run into all the weird issues.

\- System info showed I was still running 21.10.

\- Trying to mount my dual-booted Windows 11 system resulted in a complete system freeze, reboot required to get out of it.

\- Keyboard shortcuts not working (Super+T didn't launch terminal, for instance)

\- Could not install or upgrade anything via the terminal. All resulted several **The following packages have unmet dependencies** errors. It suggested running **apt --fix-broken install**, but trying to do so even using sudo just resulted in more errors.

\- rEFInd was not showing up, and it was booting directly into Pop.

\- Trying to run the upgrade again through System Upgrade resulted in an error.

**The Fix**

In the terminal, I ran

`pop-upgrade release repair`

This took a couple of minutes, during which it didn't appear to be doing anything. But I waited around until it finished. Then I ran the following:

`sudo apt --fix-broken install --allow-downgrades`

I then restarted and reinstalled the upgrade. (I used the system tool rather than the command line for this.)

After the system upgraded, I rebooted. I chose to press F12 to go into boot manager, and I booted into the 22.04 kernel. (Note that this is not what you should usually do, and I don't know if it is the best course of action. I just know it's what I did because of some of the things I went through when trying to fix it.)

I checked to be sure everything was working, and everything functioned perfectly! I just took one extra (probably unnecessary) step, because I have rEFInd, and it had broken in a previous update.

`sudo apt install --reinstall refind`

I rebooted. And that's all! I hope this is helpful for someone else. Good luck! 😊",pop_os,1650996221.0

What the guide seems to neglect: some of those gpg key files seem to be ""ascii armored"" and for all I know have to be dearmored for apt to use them.

Also for unzipping, not an ideal choice. Sure, unzip is useful. Don't know if it still makes sense to use p7zip as with Ubuntu 22.04 the official 7zip Linux version is available. Other than that, if you have to handle lots of .tar.gz files or similar on the shell, consider installing atool. Totally outdated pearl scrip that doesn't support zstd and that makes it difficult to set flags for comoression, but other than that a very capable tool to handle most things your have to do with archives. Haven't found anything better yet. UI wise I can recommend Peazip for any desktop OS. Sadly it doesn't integrate with nautilus afaik, but it can handle pretty much any format you can throw on it.

Also installing OBS through a ppa seems outdated. Ubuntu has it in their official repo since 18.04 and hasn't yet forced it into a snap.",pop_os,1651007662.0

Right. Been running Linux and FreeBSD since 1998 but I don't know how to debug and solve such issues. a) I solved the issue manually, and b) when files vanish on your system what do you do to debug the root cause?

A few months ago, I was thinking to give it to my dad but since he is using some software that can't be used on linux, I formatted it to work on windows.

4288,post,92,ucge6e,Upgrade Help Thread,"Before upgrading, back up any data you need in case of a failure to upgrade. If you have any PPAs that replaced core OS components, you should purge them from the system and downgrade back to system default packages. The Pipewire PPA is one such PPA that's caused some headaches for some. You should also expect that any third party software installed from a PPA likely isn't going to work in 22.04 without being reinstalled for 22.04. Flatpak applications will continue to work normally as before because they do not rely on system libraries.

---

After packages have been fetched, you are asked to reboot the system if the update was done from a terminal. The update dialog will automatically reboot the system on clicking the reboot button in the dialog. Do not run `apt [dist-upgrade | full-upgrade | upgrade]` at this point because the package lists are pointing to Jammy and doing so will commence an online upgrade which will have a high risk of failure. And if you do happen to run that, don't stop the process because doing so will make the system unbootable.

---

While packages are being upgraded, do not manually restart the system under any circumstances. Doing so will result in a broken system that cannot be repaired. The upgrade process will bail on its own if it could not automatically repair packages, so if it has not rebooted then it is busy installing or repairing some packages that failed.

If during upgrade you see only a black screen while the upgrades are being performed, pressing a function key like F4 will toggle between the console and Plymouth theme. I've seen some systems (VMs in particular) that don't display anything unless it's been toggled. It may also be related to the display being used. And if you have multiple monitors or a TV plugged in then be careful that the Plymouth screen might only be showing on one of them.

---

If an upgrade fails and you're able to log in with a system, you can try to manually repair with

    pop-upgrade release repair
    sudo apt-get install -f
    sudo apt-get full-upgrade --allow-downgrades

If that fails, and you have a recovery partition, you will have noticed that the recovery partition was updated in advance of the release upgrade. Hold space while booting to select the recovery partition and use the Refresh OS option in the dialog. The Refresh OS feature will retain the user account and files in the `/home` directory.

If you did not have a recovery partition, you can image a 22.04 ISO on a USB drive and use the refresh OS feature from there as well. This is the same environment as the recovery partition.

---

When reporting issues, you can also grab the contents of `/var/log/upgrade.log` for getting info on how the upgrade failed. It's also ideal to get a list of manually installed packages with `apt-mark showmanual > packages.txt` so that we can replicate that as a test sample.",pop_os,1650990091.0

* Boot and crash
* Try various kernels until you get one that takes you all the way to the login screen
* use CTRL + ALT + F5 to get the TTY and log in (https://support.system76.com/articles/login-loop-pop/)
* check how much space is available `/boot ` I didn't note the absolute amount of space, but I was having issues until I got the free % down to 60%. You can check with  `df -H`, it should show you something like this:

```
Filesystem             Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/data-root  979G  699G  231G  76% /
[...]
/dev/nvme0n1p1         490M  271M  182M  60% /boot
```
The line at the bottom is the interesting one.

* you want know what is located in /boot, so do `ls -a /boot` 
* you want to know what kernels are installed, so do `sudo dpkg -l | tail -n +6 | grep -E 'linux-image-[0-9]+' | grep -Fv $(uname -r)` (yes, this is kinda annoying to type)
* Ideally, you want to remove some of the kernels from the above list by running `sudo dpkg --purge linux-image-[INSERT VERSION]` (use tab to autocomplete)
* I was having issues with `sudo dpkg --purge ` so I ended up simply removing files related to the kernels directly in /boot by doing `sudo rm config-5.[INSERT VERSION]`, `sudo rm System.map-5.[INSERT VERSION]` , `sudo rm initrd.img-5.[INSERT VERSION]`, `sudo rm vmlinuz-5..[INSERT VERSION]` - This is not recommended, but not sure what the alternative would be and it ended up working.

There's probably a root vs userspace issue (i.e. did I run `$ sudo
pip3 install` or `$ pip3 install`?) but I figured I'd share what
worked for me (reinstalling via `$ pip3 install`) in case someone else
ran into a python dependency issue.

4300,comment,2,i6hs10h,,"Thinkpad P1 Gen 4 here. i9/3080. Running 22.04 and I have a stable laptop until I plug in my thunderbolt docking station. The whole system freezes. There are 2 external displays plugged into the dock along with an ethernet adapter and my mouse/keyboard.

No idea how to begin troubleshooting since I have to hit the reset button on the bottom of the thinkpad to reboot it after it freezes. I suspect it has something to do with the external displays though?

The setup was working fine in 20.04 and in 21.10 before that. There was a bugged update released for 21.10 that caused a similar problem in the beginning of April that made me downgrade to 20.04.

An update on my sound problems after an upgrade from an almost fresh install of 21.10 to the new 22.04. Initially I thought I had no sound but now I realize that is not quiet true, I actually do some have output but it is really really low, barely audio at all except with all levels up to max and with complete ambient silence.

none the less, i guess that's good news of sorts.

i also note that I only have sound at all if I select HDMI outputs, even though I don't have any HDMI plugged in and i am told it is unplugged and not available, when I select it. i also get this very low output when I select built-in audio profile off. very odd

anyone ever experience anything like this?

I have been running 20.04 on my desktop for about 1.5+ years without any problems. My plan has always been to upgrade at the latest possible time to the next LTS. This would have been 24.04 based on the Ubuntu release cycle. 

However, now I'm not sure if the LTS period for POP OS is the same as Ubuntu (5 years) or just until the next LTS - which would be now. Also, what would that exactly mean in practice? No updates for 20.04 from now on? Or would it still get security/maintenance updates until 2025?

On an another note. After updating to 21.10, I went straight for the next download, then checked full-upgrade and have ~2000 packages to upgrade. 

I wonder if the 22.04 download includes those upgrades as there's a lot of similar names to `sudo apt-get full-upgrade` listing when observing through `journalctl -u pop-upgrade -f`.

I did save the output from my terminal but, of course, I can't access my files.

I did not backup before upgrading because I had no reason to think it would make my desktop unusable. I don't have a lot of files to really backup, but it would be reassuring to just double-check to make sure there isn't something I need. However, I can't access the home folder from a Live USB - I didn't enable encryption during setup (even though my swap partition shows as CRYPTSWAP) but I'm suspecting something else is preventing me from accessing the home folder.

Terrific, and everything seems to work.

But I would like to fix the 5.16.19 kernel ZSTD Compressed data corruption.

I've tried the options in first post by the OP with no success (hail Mary really).

As well I tried to remove the kernel via the instructions from u/Sartanen unfortunately as mentioned in that post they ended up manually deleting the kernel images from /boot.  Which I have not wanted to try, yet.

And I don't believe I'm running low on disk space, df -H returns the following.

I've also run ""sudo update-initramfs -u -k  all"" hoping this would rebuild the kernel image.

I would kind of like to be able to run on the latest kernel image or at the very least remove it so only **Pop GNU/Linux, with Linux 5.16.15-76051619-generic** is loaded at boot (so I don't have to hold the space bar if I reboot).

I'm also concerned how this might impact any future kernel updates?

Maybe I just wait for the next one and hope it fixes everything?

#### Upgrading
During the upgrade: computer crashed, showing `/shutdown: error while loading shared libraries: libsystemd-shared-249.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`. Stayed here for a few hours, hoping it might fix itself, but no dice. Manually restarted by long-pressing the power button.

After restarting, the system reported that the upgrade did not complete successfully due to the `cpp` package not being configured correctly (this is because I had used `update-alternatives` to get C++20, and ran into some incompatibilities with the `cpp` package being set as a slave to `gcc`, so it could not be upgraded). I _think_ I have solved this problem by resetting the `update-alternatives` config to default through the CLI.

Then, I ran `pop-upgrade release repair` and `sudo apt-get install -f`, both of which succeeded after fixing the `cpp` problem. At this point, `sudo apt policy` shows only Jammy PPAs, so I don't think there's any interference from third-party PPAs causing problems.

#### After Upgrading

Tried the steps on this [system76 troubleshooting page](https://support.system76.com/articles/login-loop-ubuntu/) – added new user (no difference), tried to move config files at the specified locations (there were none), reinstalled the login manager, blacklisted Radeon driver. Nothing helped, still have a black cursor.

```
pop-upgrade recovery upgrade from-release
```

(As per the [System76 instructions](https://support.system76.com/articles/upgrade-pop/)).

After running (also painful is every time it runs it re-downloads the files!) I get this error:

```
Recovery upgrade status: recovery upgrade aborted: failed to write version of ISO now stored on the recovery partition
```

I've tried `sudo` and that makes no difference. I have plenty of space on this disk (200+gb free) so I don't think it's that. At this point I'm not sure what else I can try. Any pointers greatly appreciated :)

Edit: 

Doing `df -h` shows that `/recovery` is 73% full: it's 4GB and 2.9GB is used. I wonder if there isn't enough room on there to put the new recovery install on, as it seems to download approx 3gb? I dual boot with Windows (but each OS is on its own SSD) if that makes a difference.

I tried to empty `/recovery`:

```
sudo bash -c ""rm -rf /recovery/casper-*"" && pop-upgrade recovery upgrade from-release
```

But it fails to remove anything as the file system is read-only. Do I need to do something to mount it as read-write temporarily to fix this issue?

Edit again: I've now mounted `/recovery as read-write:

```
sudo mount -o remount,rw /dev/sdc2 /recovery

2. In the /boot/efi partition, there's not only recovery image for Pop but also for Windows! This is VERY surprising to me since I'm dual booting with Windows on another drive.

I forgot to mention that when I initially installed PopOS 21.10 I had to upgrade the kernel to 5.17.3-051703-generic in order to get wifi working. Not sure if this matters or not.",pop_os,1651062197.0

```
Recovery upgrade status: recovery upgrade aborted: failed to copy kernel to recovery

Caused by:
    failed to copy ""/recovery/casper-ACF7-DE6A/initrd.gz"" to ""/boot/efi/EFI/Recovery-ACF7-DE6A/initrd.gz"": No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

Seems like it's trying to copy the recovery files that I deleted and I'm not sure why.

Edit: I ran:

```
journalctl -u pop-upgrade
```

And hit `End` to see the last messages, and I see lots that look like:

```
Apr 28 20:25:36 pop-os pop-upgrade[5719]: rsync: [receiver] open ""/recovery/dists/unstable/Release.gpg"" failed: Read-only>
```

So it looks like the upgrade process is trying to write to `/recovery` but failing. I've tried to mount the drive as read-write as per my previous comment and trying again, but if this doesn't work I'm not sure what else to try, so any pointers are appreciated!

Update: that failed, but I noticed when then running `/mount` that `/recovery` is set to read-only again.

It seems like when I run `mount ...` to put it into read-write that works, but then during the pop-upgrade process it gets set back to read-only, and then it can't write to the disk as required.

I'm lost at this point :(",pop_os,1651173011.0

4457,comment,3,i6ccp70,,"It closely follows Ubuntu’s release and EOL schedule.

Every 2 years, there is an LTS release, which are always the April release on even years… 18.04, 20.04, and now 22.04

Between those are “standard” releases, every 6 months in October and April (of odd years). Since 20.04 (LTS released April 2020), there has been 20.10 (October 2020), 21.04 (April 2021), and 21.10 (October 2021).  As you can see, the version numbers are YY.MM to make it easy.

LTS releases get 5 years of update support\*

Standard releases, however, are only supported for 9 months, essentially giving you a 3 month window to upgrade once the next version comes out.

So, most folks either follow one of two plans: either upgrade to the latest release every ~6 months, or stick to only LTS versions and upgrade every ~2 years.  (Edit: there are advantages to both strategies, which I won’t dive into here…)

In other words, you can always determine the EOL from the version number itself.

I'm close to trading up from Ubuntu 20.04 to Pop OS 22.04 but and failing to find a way to output high bit-rate audio to a DAC over USB which is a deal-breaker for me.  

With the PulseAudio version in the 20.04 repos I can get 192kbps over USB .  Windows 11 will actually do a dreamy 384.  I know there is a version of PulseAudio which will do 384 (version 9.0, I believe) and have been waiting on this getting integrated with someone's LTS.

I was hopeful Pop 22.04 could be the vehicle with the switch to PipeWire but so far as I can make out this is globally limited to 48kbps with no option to configure.  This is very much not as good.

Does anyone know whether there is anything to be done about this just now and/or of any relevant development plans for Pop?",pop_os,1650988459.0

4669,comment,6,i69edr6,,"why do you think any data is lost?


go to the consoles (alt ctrl-f1 through f7),

see if you can login , see if your users data is still there.


assuming it's all good... for my typical testing procedure.


1. make a new test user ` sudo adduser billgates `

2. install a secondary minimal Window manager. ` sudo apt install openbox`

3. reboot. `sudo reboot`


now for the testing..

1. see if the problem user can login,
2.  see if the problem user can login using the openbox window manager. there is a gear icon on the login manager screen.
3. see if the new user can login using either the original Desktop, or under openbox.


------

Depending on the tests..

* if the old user can login under the Openbox, and new user can get to the old Desktop that points to a problem In the broken users home setting files.

you can try to login at the console, or use the openbox Wm, and rename your **.config**  directory to **.config-old**  then try to login again.

that MIGHT reset whatever broken settings are messed up.  This is the fix for most cases when I see that error screen.


You can then move back any needed configs from the . config-old directory back to .config

-----

If neither user can login into the default DE and if the openbox Wm also fails, that's a sign of deeper system wide problems.

Which may be a bit harder to fix.

A complaint I've got about the new 22.04 update is how the Pop!\_Shop doesn't show if the software has the format flatpak or deb anymore if only one of them are available. Pop!\_Shop only shows this information if there are two different versions (allowing the user to pick the desired one). 

So to find out what format the installation is in, I have to install the program first and then check if it's in flatpak or not, and then uninstall if it's in an undesired format. The reason why this is a problem is because I would rather have a snap than a flatpak, due to the snap version being more quick, so if a program is only available as a flatpak via the Pop!\_Shop I'd rather install the Snap verison.",pop_os,1650971243.0

More quick? I can't recall ever noticing much difference in how fast the programs run using the various methods.  I tend to  choose one source over the other based on the specific version of a program.  Flatpaks may be newer than the snap and so on.

But if you search for, say, `mpv` (Called just ""mpv"" as a flatpak, but ""mpv Video Player"" as a deb pkg) these both show up as separate softwares--like Shop doesn't understand they should be ""linked"".

Yes, wine was installed. First time I tried to upgrade I used the upgrade method in the desktop GUI under settings. That one failed and ended up in broken state.

""pop-upgrade release upgrade"" that worked flawless.",pop_os,1650978319.0
4776,comment,1,i6xzxmd,,"Alright, I'm hear to post what worked for me - but I don't think this was the proper way to go about it necessarily lol. Just letting others know what worked for me so they can better troubleshoot this issue.

**So use/experiment with this at your own risk!:**

This was the issue that was flashing up for me after a failed Pop OS upgrade from 21.04 to 22.04, when attempting to upgrade through the Settings GUI. Like others, I was unable to upgrade any packages or do much via apt because of these unmet dependencies.

My angry, middle-of-the-night ""solution"" was simply to open a terminal and input the following:

    pop-upgrade release upgrade

To my surprise it started going through with what it needed to do. It went through its full upgrade processes and completed that process after a reboot. On the reboot however, the desktop environment wasn't working >:/ So I logged out & instead of inputting my password whilst at the login screen, I used **CTRL + ALT + F3** to get into the ""tty3"" terminal.

From there I ran ""sudo apt update"" and found that quite a few packages were missing. Nearly 1k needed to be upgraded. so I ran ""sudo apt full-upgrade""; however, this showed me a fairly simple error. My terminal was saying that the **python3-repolib package** was throwing up this error:

    ""Sub-process /user/bin/dpkg/python3-repolib returned an error code (1)""

The usual ""**dpkg --configure -a""** wasn't working to resolve this error though, which was odd - it just repeated the same thing...So! At the recommendation of another Reddit user, I ran the following:

    sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/info/python3-repolib.*
    sudo dpkg --configure -a
    sudo apt full-upgrade

This process recreated a new python3-repolib and didn't throw the same sub-process error. After this, I was able to continue with updating the remaining packages on the system.

After all that was finished, I checked to make sure all packages were up to date once more - and with no snags and everything green-lit, I ran a simple shutdown command in the tty3 to fully turn off the computer (just to get a clean start).

With a fresh press of the power button, Everything now works again and no files were lost! :) I cannot guarantee you'll have the same experience or missing packages as me, as this was just a case of me bruteforcing my way through an install of Pop which I had no risk of losing data on (already backed up in a few other places). I've had a lot of upgrading issues with Pop\_OS in my lifetime of using it, unlike my other distros I maintain, so I was a bit fed up this time. Maybe I got lucky in a resolution or maybe this'll help somebody else out :P

Good luck out there!",pop_os,1651435450.0

I only see one problem: When adding some programs to the startup applications, I end up with a mess on my first workspace. I would like to be able to start each app on one worspace.

I came up with following script, but that doesn't work yet.

```sh

   until [ -z ""$(wmctrl -lx | grep ""$name"")"" ]; do
      sleep 0.2

And it was fixed.





Hey    
I decided to do a fresh 22.04 install yesterday, and everything seemed fine.
Today i got an [update](https://imgur.com/a/cXJWEpk) in the pop shop, but the pop shop closes before finishing when i hit update.
I tried to do it in the terminal and get this error:    
*$ sudo apt upgrade
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
You might want to run 'apt --fix-broken install' to correct these.
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 libgl1-mesa-dri : Breaks: libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 (!= 22.0.1-1ubuntu2) but 22.1.0~rc2+git2204221800.cfc3827890c~j~mesarc0 is installed
 libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 : Breaks: libgl1-mesa-dri (!= 22.1.0~rc2+git2204221800.cfc3827890c~j~mesarc0) but 22.0.1-1ubuntu2 is installed
E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt --fix-broken install' with no packages (or specify a solution).*    


If i do sudo apt --fix-broken install i get:    
*dpkg-deb: error: paste subprocess was killed by signal (Broken pipe)
Errors were encountered while processing:
 /var/cache/apt/archives/libgl1-mesa-dri_22.1.0~rc2+git2204221800.cfc3827890c~j~
mesarc0_amd64.deb
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)*

I then tried all the troubleshooting steps i could find, but ended up breaking the system after removing the packages manually.

I did a fresh install again and am having the same issue.

Upgraded to 22.04 today. Had to use -f, didn't think much of it.

Upon boot, I'm greeted with the familiar gray screen of the gnome sign in, but no profile shows, no mouse, no nothing. After 20 or 30 seconds, I go into recovery mode. From what I can gather, this recovery mode is running in 21.10, the version I was using prior. That being said, looking at my /boot folder, I do have a couple partitions labeled with the kernel 22.04 is using (5.16.19, iirc)

Running apt update, it appears that none of the 2000 plus packages are registering as downloaded. Running apt upgrade, it shows... Nothing upgrading. I really hope this doesn't have to do with the fact I use a VPN...

Running pop-upgrade, I'm able to say update to the newest release, it says pop-upgrade is checking for an update, and then after about 40 seconds or so the message comes on the screen that I'm in recovery mode again (though it doesn't clear the terminal).

In case it matters: It is Luks encrypted partition with ext4 filesystem. The key file exists on root partition with corresponding cryptab entry. This filesystem does get auto-mounted on fresh boot or reboots successfully. No issues there.

4910,post,1,uc4cnn,New LTS Update broke my GRUB....,"I installed Pop OS yesterday, dual boot with my Windows 11 (both on same drive). Managed to do everything fine. I had a working dual boot with a working Grub, but it's all fun and games until they decide to update...

Since I just installed it and is my first time EVER using any Distro, I thought this update was just an normal update for a fresh installed OS, but after it finished updating, my grub now loads into this screen....

PopOS boots fine, Windows boots fine, only grub is having a problem.

EDIT: In case someone appear here looking for a solution, I just followed the grub guide again, like it was my first time setting up grub, and now everything is working.

PS: Some people are curious how I managed to have all of this working on UEFI. I have no idea 👍

Install htop, run it in CLI, and then F2 to add the disk I/O columns. Also check its display of swap usage; it should be low or non-existent.

  


Also, sudo dmesg to see the most recent kernel messages. If you see anything in there about the disk (sda, sdb, etc), it's time to back up your important stuff and swap in a new drive.

I think you've ruled out video issues, switching to dGPU and then also seeing the proper Mesa renderer for your iGPU.

  


If you have just started up a session, and aren't watching video or playing a game, you shouldn't be seeing CPU usage that high. In htop you can sort by CPU usage--what processes are using the most CPU cycles?

  


NVMe is disk over PCIe, so I do think those errors are relevant. The sda/sdb device name is specifically for \[S\]ATA \[D\]ISK, so if you have an NVMe drive then you wouldn't expect to see the SATA device names, and would see something like nvme0n1p1 instead (the numbers mean first (zero-th) registered NVMe device, first namespace, first partition).

  


Try dmesg --follow to see if the kernel is constantly outputting errors. I used to do laptop repair and would see constant streams of errors & device resets when a disk was starting to fail and I was testing it on Linux. And although my experience was admittedly before NVMe, I believe there are similar reset commands on the PCIe bus. If these are constantly being outputted, and say only 1% of disk writes are successful, it could cause processes that write small amounts of data (syslog/rsyslog) to the disk to use lots of CPU time, either re-issuing the failed writes or holding the CPU on a ""blocking"" operation until the write is successful.

  


One way you can isolate between the disk and, well, everything else, is booting from a live USB stick. Starting up a live environment, like an OS installer, uses only the RAM and not the hard drive, but you can still open a browser and test video playback. If it works perfectly, then you've confirmed the problem is the disk. Then, still in the live environment, you can try mounting the drive manually and seeing if read or write operations on it are the only time your experience slows down. Try gparted for this, or your favorite partition editor. Small programs like that can even be ""installed"" in the live environment, just downloaded and saved in RAM without using the disk at all.

  


In the meantime, before you do any further testing, make sure you have backups of your important data from that drive.",pop_os,1650944731.0

However as soon as I open up a video in firefox or a project in VisualStudio, or both which I frequently do, the usage goes up to 100%+ for both processes.

I tried the dmesg command you recommended and it seems that there are some nvme errors occurring. There seems to usually be a few every couple minutes. On one occasion I did see a flurry of them all at once but havent seen that again yet.

I also checked syslog and I am seeing a constant stream of the following errors 

`Apr 26 12:07:21 pop-os io.elementary.a[4308]: hdy_carousel_box_get_n_pages: assertion 'HDY_IS_CAROUSEL_BOX (self)' failedApr 26 12:07:21 pop-os io.elementary.a[4308]: hdy_carousel_box_get_position: assertion 'HDY_IS_CAROUSEL_BOX (self)' failed`

I did a bit of searching but cant seem to figure out what this is.

As for the live usb, I did try that as well and while it might not be as slow, I did still notice stuttering in video and some lag as well which I usually never experience.

At this point I think the most likely option is the drive as you mentioned, but I dont understand why I am experiencing stuttering in videos on the live usb then. In my experience the live usb is usually very snappy and nothing really lags.

As for themes, from what i recall, the Gnome Devs have been trying to do some 'stuff' to make theming more consistent, but that means Distro makers cant customize as much as they want.  So it was a bit of a back and forth yelling match for a while.  

I never really paid much attention to it all.  :) I tend to just use the defaults, or do minor tweaks.  Both sides made some valid points, and there was a lot of dirty laundy being aired that really should have not been.

4995,comment,1,i6auldh,,"That depends entirely on the packages to be removed. `apt` serves no purpose there since it will try to remove everything anyways. Running `dpkg -r libpipewire` will give you some warnings. That's how I found out about libmutter. After that it was common sense: ""before installing pipewire my system didnt know about the existence of the PPA, so a fresh copy of libmutter should do it!"". For other kind of software (e.g. wine) the situation might be easier/difficult, especially when copling lots of libraries into the mix. Anyhow, any operation that involves removing the gnome-shell or mutter is a big sign of PPAs integrating deeply within your system. Tracking down which library/binary you have to replace with a clean copy means going through *each* of the packages installed by said software, and trying to remove them with `dpkg -r` one by one.

Beware: this works BEFORE doing a dist upgrade. If you already started the process, chances are you already fetched newer packages and are in the middle of dependency hell. In that case, the way is not removing but rather installing the newer version of those missing packages (manually downloading and installing from the new release repositories)

When launching with UEFI, I get the ""Install or Try Pop!_OS"" message, and after hitting enter the screen simply goes to a flat grey color and nothing happens from there, even if I wait for several minutes.

5186,comment,1,i6eki6o,,"Very buggy here. Intel ISO created with Etcher. All updates applied. Pop Shell in use and Wayland enabled. (I still can't believe you have to edit config files to enable it.)

1. 2x hard freezes requiring machine to be shut down with power button. Both occurred while windows resized after closing third window. I can't reproduce the behavior.
2. Pop Shop images jump, disappear and reappear - like it's being refreshed or reloaded.
3. Gnome cursor rotation bug is present. My second monitor is rotated left, the cursor rotates to match the monitor. Gets stuck in the orientation even when moving back to first monitor.
4. Slow boot process, Grub boots, blank grayish brown screen for a few seconds, loads GDM, enter password, another blank screen for a few seconds, frozen cursor appears for a few seconds, then everything pops into place.
5. Every windows opens full screen, then snaps into place.

That's all I can remember. I love Pop OS and Pop Shell but I'll have to wait for now.

**EDIT: New update this morning, no change. All of the above still apply.**

But more info, Files opens completely on the secondary monitor (rotated left) then snaps to the primary monitor. Terminal, Pop Store and Firefox open still open full screen on primary monitor, then snap to the right size.

Cursor rotation bug now occurs at boot, cursor rotated left on primary monitor but corrects itself if I move the cursor to the secondary monitor and back.

Begin small rant here --- How in the hell can SwayWM correctly set two wallpapers and rotation of monitors with two lines, but Gnome cant? Here is my sway config lines.

output VGA-1 {pos 0 0 res 1600x900 transform 90 bg ~/Pictures/gruvbox_left.png fill}

output HDMI-A-1 {pos 900 0 res 1920x1080 bg ~/Pictures/gruvbox_right.png fill}

No cursor rotation bug, no zoomed wallpaper on the left monitor. Ok, rant over.

**LAST EDIT: I'm pulling the plug.**

New hard crash - disabling pop extensions, hard to power off. On reboot cursor bug still present but now it rotates to the correct orientation on second monitor but remains rotated on primary monitor.

Two invisible windows present ""gjs"" something, couldn't close them, had to reboot.

Since `nvidia-detector` works nicely, a simple `sudo apt install \`nvidia-detector\`` would do the trick on the command line, so the installer could select the correct driver automatically, but I don't know if it does.

Select the best option for the downgrade, don't worry about unmet/recommended dependencies at this point, you just need to replace the PPA version with the ubuntu version.

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

That will install the stuff that was pushed today, and it will likely fail - because there's a package (I think it was pipewire-media-session, but I could be wrong) that will stop the upgrade. When it fails:

sudo apt purge <package name>

Kidding. This is a great effort to fix someone's borked upgrade. Are you the person that was sent out to smooth out mmstick's bedside manner ;-)

What is the reason for all the problems here? All my upgrades (during the beta phase) and the refresh installs (keep user data), worked smoothly. One problem with an inconsistent state, but that was due to a mid-update power-cut - not System76's fault.

More updates then before... great job pop dev team squash them bugs!!

Default configuration, first boot, Pop Shell not enabled, on Xorg.

Boot process remains unchanged - it's slow.

Pop Shop images still jump and flash.

No cursor bug present...

Able to remove extensions without crash.

Pop Shell enabed from here on.

Windows open on left monitor VGA-1 (rotated left), then snap onto correct one HDMI-1 (default), unless VGA-1 has something on it. Then they open on HDMI-1 full screen then snap to tilling.

Pop Shop images still jump and flash, reproducible - Open Shop, select installed, and select any item. Left everything load, click so Pop Shop loses focus - images jump disappear and reload, select Shop and they flash disappear and reload. This makes sense since the authorization dialog box steals focus so for whatever reason Pop Shop reloads the images.

Wayland enabled from here on.

Everything still the same as above. Cursor bug IS NOW present! This is interesting to me because this bug was ""squashed"" 2 years ago.

I'll give them some more time, I figured there would be issues. However, no Wayland is a deal breaker since it was fine the last release for years. My love/hate relationship with Gnome grows ever deeper...

Not really a Pop\_OS! problem, in general package managers handle upgrades gracefully, downgrades require manual intervention and may break automated upgrades.

If you use PPAs and are not an expert, it is usually best to install fresh, rather than upgrade. There are simply too many variables for an automated upgrade to be reliable.

I believe that this could be because of the specific file transfer protocol used by Android to show up as a drive on your computer, which is different from a standard USB drive. If you plugged your phone into a Windows machine, you would see that the icon that would show up in Explorer denoting the new drive is different from that of the icon that would show up if you'd used an USB drive/External SSD.

This is most definitely not a Nautilus issue, because I have experienced this (and continue to experience this) on Thunar, dolphin and even Windows Explorer. Perhaps there is something you can do on your phone that could change this behavior but I am not very sure.

&#x200B;

With Cosmic Workspaces enabled, the Primary monitor just shows a orange dot in the upper left corner where the Workspace preview would normally be. If you plug in additional monitors, they will show it fine, its just the primary monitor that will show the orange dot instead.

&#x200B;

If you disable Cosmic Workspaces than the Primary monitor will show a single Workspace when entering workspace switcher mode, while the others will show the additional ones to the left and right.

&#x200B;

Anyone know whats going on or how to configure it correctly?

sudo systemctl start mbpfan

But when I reset my PC, it automatically booted me into Windows without asking me which OS I want to use. So, I reset my PC and tried to boot my HDD by using the ""Boot Device"" menu screen. However, when it booted up, it brought me into a BusyBody terminal. I looked up on YouTube how to fix this but the whole `fsck /dev/sda2` command doesn't work.

Does anyone know of a possible fix?

**Notes**:  
* This bug exists on both Wayland and Xorg, and also if I log in under a stock Gnome session rather than on Pop.   
* This was recorded on a clean guest session, so no third party extensions are causing it.  
* This bug doesn't occur on Ubuntu or Fedora, so it seems to be a Pop-only issue.

Turns out, the problem is with the keyboard shortcut I was using.

So you typed python3 and it showed you the version.  Good. You should have also seen "">>> "" you could type python statements here... like:

'print(message)'

When you click \[Enter\] after the second statement, it should give you 'hello'

But that wouldn't be the best way to code. You could use the text editor. Just name the file, e.g, 'hello'.  To run the file, just type 'python3 hello'. I typically add "".py"" to any files coded with the text editor.

i personally use either VS Studio Code or Atom.  For VS Studio Code, you'll have to install the python add-on, but that's easy. From the top bar under 'File' select 'New File'.

5597,post,1,uazr02,WITS END: Sleep/Hibernate on Lid Close?,"I have a Framework laptop running Pop-OS and unless I fully shut the machine down every time I leave it alone, I inevitably come back to a dead battery. This makes my very basic and ingrained laptop user behavior loop untenable: ""work a bit, shut lid, go about day/travel, return and open lid to resume where I left off.""

I have dug into this problem, edited config files and swap files and partitions, deep sleep vs. hibernate etc. watched YouTubers set it up, and done tutorial after tutorial on fresh OS installs, and I am basically just exhausted as the problem persists. Either the ""hibernate"" ends up being a shutdown saving nothing, or it doesn't actually get to a lower power state and keeps draining the battery. After giving up about a month ago, I'm writing this as a last ditch effort to see if anyone in the community has figured this out and can help.

**What I want is when close the lid, the machine to go into some form of ""low power mode"" so that if I pick it back up in the next 10-15 minutes it will bounce back to the state I was in, but if I don't that it will ""suspend to memory"" and go into an ultra low power/0-power state so if I don't touch it for a week, I won't return to a dead battery.**

I know that there is someone out there who has figured this out and it is a piece of cake for them, so are you out there? I've seen the other threads in this sub with similar issues, but honestly I am either too dumb to follow what they did, or their setup is just different enough to where it won't work on my machine.

Again, it is a Framework laptop, 11th Gen Intel Core i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz × 8 with Mesa Intel® Xe Graphics (TGL GT2) running Pop!_OS 21.10. My 1TB SSD is not encrypted, and I have a 19GB Linux Swap partition at /dev/mapper/cryptswap which I honestly don't remember if I created or that was the initial set up. I am willing to totally wipe this machine and set it up fresh to get this to work as it is the number 1 reason why I am not using it as often as I might otherwise.

I am a slightly above average normie user: savvy enough to have built my own machines, and to even be on GNU/Linux (that's right!), but noobish enough to be frustrated with this issue and I am a PRO at following directions. 

Basically, I know that what I want is basic Macbook style behavior, so I am hoping some of the fine people on the sub will take mercy on me and help me stay in the Pop_OS user world instead of running back to the Apple ecosystem I left 2 years ago. BTW, the rest of my machines (ThinkPad laptops, custom desktops, and a Sys76 Thelio) work flawlessly on Pop-OS...

Please help and thanks in advance!",pop_os,1650821432.0

5599,comment,3,i614j7l,,"I have a framework, running Pop!\_OS, with suspend-then-hubernate set up, I wouldn't say that it was a piece of cake, but I am happy to list what I have done.

I am using disk encryption. If you need to set up the swap volume with encryption you can follow these steps: [https://support.system76.com/articles/enable-hibernation/](https://support.system76.com/articles/enable-hibernation/)

If you're not using encryption you should be able to set up the volume or file following one of the many guides floating around for Pop or if need be for ubuntu. Since I didn't do that I can't weigh in on which ones may be good or bad.

For hibernate you will need to make sure that you have a partition or file that is iirc 2gb larger than your ram. Once you have the swap volume or file set up this page: [https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/power/basic-pm-debugging.html](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/power/basic-pm-debugging.html) will help you to test if it is working .

Then you will need to set your system to do what you want. In settings->power you can configure suspend time on battery and on ac.

Next, edit /etc/systemd/sleep.confHere's the relevant portion from mine:

    [Sleep]
    #AllowSuspend=yes
    #AllowHibernation=yes
    #AllowSuspendThenHibernate=yes
    #AllowHybridSleep=yes
    #SuspendMode=
    #SuspendState=mem standby freeze
    #HibernateMode=platform shutdown
    #HibernateState=disk
    #HybridSleepMode=suspend platform shutdown
    #HybridSleepState=disk
    #HibernateDelaySec=180min
    HibernateDelaySec=720min

Also edit /etc/systemd/logind.conf

Relevant parts again:

    . . .
    #HandlePowerKey=poweroff
    #HandleSuspendKey=suspend
    #HandleHibernateKey=hibernate

    #IdleAction=ignore
    IdleAction=suspend-then-hibernate
    #IdleActionSec=30min
    IdleActionSec=30min
    . . .

where the ... is just removing info that isn't relevant here.

Finally, I ran `sudo update-initramfs -c -k all` once I had things configured how I wanted them. That rebuilds for all kernels, so might be overkill, but I was having an issue with wifi not coming back after hibernate once I switched the setup to wait 12 hours prior to hibernation. The battery drain overnight is low enough (using 4x USB-C expansion cards) that I decided to save some wear on the SSD.

5600,comment,2,i61b5rb,,"So, I have a Framework laptop, and was having the same frustration you were.  I've gotten suspend-then-hybernate to work.  This is what I did (I think)---it's been a while.  If you google around, though, there are a lot of instructions on enabling suspend-then-hybernate on Pop.

Follow the instructions here to enable hybernation: [https://support.system76.com/articles/enable-hibernation/](https://support.system76.com/articles/enable-hibernation/)

Once you've tested to see that hybernation works (by using the GNOME extension that will put a suspend item in your power-off menu) do:

edit /etc/systemd/sleep.conf to change hybernate delay

HybernateDelaySec=30min

(or whatever your preferred delay is)

Also edit /etc/systemd/logind.conf to change lid close behavior

HandleLidSwitch=suspend-then-hibernate

This should make it so that when you close your lid, it will just sleep for 30 minutes (or whatever your delay is), then suspend your memory to disk.   The next time you try to wake up, it will ask you to decrypt your boot disk like a normal boot, but from there resume to where you left off.  Not quite as seamless as the Mac suspend to disk.  (For example, if your  battery runs out before you reach your hibernate delay, then you are SOL.)

Windows uses Memory compression, and what is the `vm.page-cluster` size is on Windows, linux is 32KiB.

Try setting  cluster size to 0 and then 1 `(0= 4KiB x 2^0, 1= 4KiB x 2^1)`

For a test run

    sudo sysctl -w vm.page-cluster=0

Setup  a config file:

    echo ""vm.page-cluster = 0"" |sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/90-local.conf  
    # tee -a to add a line to file

\- The default of 3 (32KiB) good for bandwidth but bad for latency, good for HDD.

Test enable compression.

    echo 1 |sudo tee /sys/module/zswap/parameters/enabled
    echo 80 |sudo tee /sys/module/zswap/parameters/max_pool_percent

Adding zswap to the kernel command line:

Also, camera does not work absolutely. Had to install DroidCam for giving lectures.
(when I installed back Windows 10/11 I wasn't able to switch the camera, so it looks like the camera software on a BIOS level was damaged).

On the bright side, when using Windows 10/11 I wasn't able to run Zoom with camera as the device's computing power didn't had such a leeway. (4*1.44 GHz Intel, 4 GB RAM). 

Pop_OS gives me ability to run Zoom with camera and sound, and two working apps simultaneously. 

It also works incorrectly if you wish to have an Asian input (in my case it was Japanese).

As for TDP you must do some simple tweaks but after completing those tweaks the heat almost nonexistent. 

TLDR; It is great for daily working on devices with low computing power. 

As well as for running more than sole single app. (Zoom in full mode + some other office app for example) 

What will you lose in exchange:

- native TDP support, you are to perform tweaks.
- ability to watch video in HD/HD+
- Adequate input for Asian languages (the only reason I was forced to return the device to windows T_T) 
- Camera (varies depending on the device)

5715,comment,2,i61sh41,,"A strategy called shotgunning was used  Trying to fix something without first identifying a defect.  Shotguning can create confusion.  And sometimes exponentially complicates a problem.

What do system event logs report?  Windows sees a defect, works around it, and records it in logs.  For example, does an error 41 appear?  Do other critical numbers identify the source of that failure?  Always collect all facts long before even asking how to fix something or disconnecting one part.

Is CMOS set to automatically restart on a shutdown?  If yes, then more facts from a BSOD may be lost.  Set the CMOS to not automatically reboot.  So that more facts can be obtained.

Another fundamental concepts.  Defects can exist and not cause a failure.  Perfectly good parts can sometimes conspire to cause a failure.  Defects and failures need not coincide.  Not understanding that can also cause confusion.

Heat is a powerful diagnostic tool.  Can identify defective parts that work intermittently in a 70 degree F room.  But fail in a 90 degree room.  Then wild speculation blames heat rather than learn from what is defective.  Everything in good computer works fine even in a 100 degree F room.  Defective parts are located easier in such rooms.

All computer manufacturers have comprehensive hardware diagnostics.  Only better ones will provide them for free.  Is your's a better manufacturer?  What did those comprehensive diagnostics report after testing every function in every subsystem.  Such tests must operate without Windows - that can work around defects.  Testing typically takes a few hours.  That many functions must be diagnosed.

Stress test rarely report anything useful.  For example Prime95 does not even stress test most of a system.  Despite urban myths that only speculate it.

Only provided were symptoms.  Those symptoms only suggest where to start obtaining facts.  Some examples of facts are above.

Never say something like ""I saw this"".  Quote every error message and always provide all numbers.  Since all that, that means nothing to most others, is saying exactly where a defect lies.  Make no conclusions.  Only post facts and numbers so that the informed finally have some facts to work with.

Do not disconnect or swap any wire or part.  That can only increase confusion.  First get and provide only facts.  Those facts clearly identify a suspect.

Are no error codes / messages in the system (event) logs such as a kernel error?   Is CMOS set to not automatically restart so that BSODs can be read and recorded?  Failures result in a report somewhere.

Foundation of all electronics is a power subsystem.  Just like in a house.  If doors are sticking, one does not replace the door.  One first verified that foundation is not crumbling.  Always identify a defect long before fixing anything.

A power subsystem (PSU is only one part) can make any good part act defectively.  Three digit numbers are obtained to determine if that subsystem is working properly.  Many make the mistake of assuming ATX standards provide all good numbers.  It doesn't.  It is only a start.  A three digit number from that meter can meet ATX standards and still be reporting defect.

Instructions are requested, two plus minutes of labor performed, and resulting numbers reported.  So that others (who better know this stuff) can say what is defective and what is exonerated ... without any doubt or speculation.

After a power subsystem is known good, then move on to obtain other relevant facts.

Good diagnostic procedure says nothing is removed or disconnected until facts with numbers are learned.  How many Googled replies said that?  A problem observed with many IT people.  They somehow know but did not first learn good diagnostic procedure or basic computer functions.

How many did not even know a power controller exists?  It also exists in other electronics such as TVs.  Pressing that front 'power on' button does not power on anything. It also is but a request to a power controller.

(no grub menu), a panic and a half later about having formatted the win11 partition while moving, resizing partitions when setting up a ""custom install"" I restarted jumped to bios changed boot priority to (wbm) and was into win11 no data loss

&#x200B;

**Shit breaks loose:** (everything done after this point was stupid in hindsight and didn't have any consideration to what the problem was) played around in the bios changing boot priorities turned on and off secure boot that's it but at one point I thought pressing the load defaults button would fix all this I pressed it applied changes and rebooted only this time to be thrown into grub cmd looking thing (don't know what it is) somehow a few internet searches later I figure out typing exit exits that thing rebooted entered bios wbm was missing went through some videos on how to add it manually didn't work somehow through a os repair recovery tool by dell (all this is happening on a dell laptop) I ended up in recovery mode of windows clicked on exit and enter windows and i was in windows again no data loss everything was intact so i didn't wipe the partition, rebooted and this time it went directly to windows checked bios wbm was back so no worries there but now i have no way of entering pop\_os!

&#x200B;

**Note:**

* my expertise with Linux is noob at best I can follow tutorials I clearly couldn't this time but I can most times link different tutorials together I always try to look up any commands or setting I change that I don't understand I have installed 3 4 different distributions as vms b4 dual booted once before I don't know to write scripts or anything like that also with a lot of internet surfing on my belt I know some jargon
* I am fine loosing the Linux partition there is no data on there I cant loose the windows partition there's a lot of imp stuff there its all synced to cloud services so not a lot to worry abt it but I don't want to install windows from scratch coz that would involve setting up a lot of apps and all again don't wanna do that. Also I am currently typing this from windows on the same laptop so windows is basically unscathed
* I looked up a lot of grub not showing up tutorials and stuff all that sounds too daunting given this experience

* uninstall the current pop os install and try again (I wanna know what the best way to do this?)
* go through one of those grub doesn't show up tutorials and try them
* uninstall the current pop os install and install ubuntu (I wanna know what the best way to do this?)
* Also currently there is no way I can access the pop os installation coz when resetting boot configuration defaults it removed the pop os boot manager entry too along with wbm so I add that(I would like to know how to do that?) and then instead of relying on grub I enter bios each time sounds stupid but I will surely need a solution to this in the future

5810,comment,3,i62dzkn,,"Just to spite you, and to show /u/dance2die I could do it, I just spent the past two hours doing it.

And I will tell you how.

I made two VMs, one with Pop!_OS 22.04, one with Ubuntu 22.04. 

First I compared the apt sources between the two VMs. Pop!_OS has nothing but comments in /etc/apt/sources.list, so I moved the Ubuntu sources.list to .old and touched a blank file.

    sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.old
    sudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list

Next, I made three files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ to match the Pop!_OS sources.

    cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
    sudo nano
    
    ^w File: pop-os-apps.sources
    X-Repolib-Name: Pop_OS Applications
    Enabled: yes
    Types: deb
    URIs: http://apt.pop-os.org/proprietary
    Suites: jammy
    Components: main
    
    ^w file: pop-os-release.sources
    X-Repolib-Name: Pop_OS Release Sources
    Enabled: yes
    Types: deb deb-src
    URIs: http://apt.pop-os.org/release
    Suites: jammy
    Components: main
       
    ^w file: system.sources
    X-Repolib-Name: Pop_OS System Sources
    Enabled: yes
    Types: deb deb-src
    URIs: http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
    Suites: jammy jammy-security jammy-updates jammy-backports
    Components: main restricted universe multiverse
    X-Repolib-Default-Mirror: http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/

Next, I needed to import the GPG key for Pop's repos. NOTE: This method works but its depreciated. It will generate warnings and you can 'man apt-key' and read the part on depreciation to see why. But I'm an insane distro mutilator, right?

    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key 204DD8AEC33A7AFF
    
    sudo apt update

After that, I changed the init level to 3 because I was going to fork with the GUI. Run level 3 is non-graphical command line only. 

    sudo init 3

Login: 

    sudo apt-remove ubuntu-desktop gnome-initial-setup
    sudo apt-install pop-desktop
    reboot

So after that, it didn't look quite right. 

    sudo apt install pop-theme --reinstall 


I rebooted: It still didn't look right. So I launched the Extensions app (GNOME extensions) and I turned on all extensions. Then it looked right.

I opened the settings app and moved the dock to the bottom. 

Now the only visual difference is the icons that are saved as ""Favorite"" to the dock. 

That can be fixed easy. 

I noticed in the settings app that the Ubuntu logo is there, but all the OS release data is Pop!_OS. 

I took a screenshot and I noticed the Window theme isn't right, the icons aren't right. Just minor tweaks. https://imgur.com/S2jLDvc

I am probably never going to use this frankenstein VM again, but... Its not broken.

In hindsight, I should have... after init 3...

    sudo apt remove ubuntu-desktop gnome-initial-setup ubuntu-gnome-default-settings ubuntu-gnome-desktop

I think that would have made the experience better.  There's probably other packages I could have done. I should have diff compared an ""apt list"" on the two VMs and removed a lot more stuff Unbuntu installed that Pop!_OS wouldn't.",pop_os,1650844803.0

The recovery partition is a nice feature, but one that i find i RARELY if ever actually use. So its not really worth messing worrying about if you dont have one.

If you are using a Legacy setup, and grub  which gets setup by default on a Legacy install, then you can setup grub to boot an ISO file.  

Or.... just keep a spare installer USB in the drawer. 

If you used RUFUS to make the installer USB, i suggest in the future you use Balena Etcher, or better yet VENTOY.

5835,comment,2,i5y2r8j,,"a Common issue is to boot the USB installer in the wrong 'mode' - Systems these days can boot using UEFI (with an efi partition, and a GPT setup drive) or In Legacy Mode with a drive setup to use MBR.

A common issue - is people boot the usb in the wrong Mode. a Single USB flsh drive can show up as TWO entries in the USB boot selection menu.   The exact text and layout of the boot menu can be very confusing and differ greatly between motherboard designs.  For example my system has entries like..


      Pop_OS:  Sandisk 16gb: UEFI
      Pop_OS: Sandisk 16gb
     (other entries)

So i can tell that the first entry boots my USB in UEFI mode.  If your drive is using GPT for the partition table.  Then you want to use UEFI mode. If your system is less than like 8 years old, it most likely supports UEFI.      Double check that the Drive is in fact using GPT for its partition table. You can use gparted to make a new partition with the 'GPT' for its type (instead of MSDOS for the old style)

Many systems have a UEFI ONLY setting in their firmware menus, again the exact text can vary. some may have a  setting with 3 options 'UEFI, Legacy, Automatic'  Or something similar - I always set my systems to be UEFI ONLY these days. 


-----------------------

So short answer:   Boot the USB - look closely to see if you are using UEFI mode. Do the install in UEFI mode.

The Mode the installer usb boots is used by the installer program to tell it how to setup the boot files. Boot up in the wrong mode, and the installer will screw up the boot file setup.  

Once the system installs and sets up the boot files on the drive, it should boot to the installed OS.

What you could do - assuming you are not dual booting and want the whole drive to be for Linux,   boot the Installer USB (again in UEFI mode)  use gparted to  make a new partition table (GPT)  and then start the installer and let it auto partition how the installer wants.  This will erase any old boot stuff on the drive (it will erase the whole drive) then do the install.

You can double check that your installer is in UEFI mode with...

      ls -l /sys/firmware/efi


If you see various files like 'efivars' and 'mok-variables'  then you are in UEFI mode.

  I think you can tell if the drive is using GPT via...

        sudo blkid /dev/sda
        /dev/sda: PTUUID=""78c515814e5a"" PTTYPE=""gpt""

Here's a guide on [how to install minecraft](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-minecraft-on-linux/) on a debian based distro. Does it make sense? This is one of the easier game installs on Linux since it is officially supported by the developer. You would be expected to do this and more for every game you want to play. Also, if you're playing an unsupported game and the developer changes something that breaks it for Linux, you're just out of luck until someone fixes it or finds a way around the issue. This happened a couple weeks ago with Apex Legends where Linux support was gone for a couple days randomly due to the devs deleting a necessary anti-cheat file on accident during a patch. Luckily the devs restored it quickly, but typically Linux users are on the bottom of the list when it comes to actionable items at a game publisher.

That said, WSL2 is available on Windows and could help you get your feet wet with Linux if you're interested in the OS. It installs a full Linux kernel underneath your Windows install which allows you to start learning Linux without giving up the ease-of-use of Windows. Once you're confident in your Linux skills, you might consider switching over.

The way I think about it, if being able to play the game and create content is more important to you than the underlying system you are running it all on, then stick with Windows. If you care more about not running Windows than playing games and are ok with the potential for random interruptions and troubleshooting unsupported issues then I'd say you might want to consider Linux.",pop_os,1650845101.0

Now once I did that on my PC (I noticed the eject option was not showing) so I shut down my pc and removed the usb since it didn'toffer thebeject. Then I went over to my lenovo (windows 7 premium service pack 1) and went to bios changed the booting to USB  HDD general Udisk. And when I loaded it up. I expected windows to be written over and for it to load smoothly. But all that happens is it loads slowly and brings me to the original windows and just load the usb as the typical opening options and gives me an option to select two files. But that's it. I'm a little lost if I messed up in the process and this lenovo i was given it was an old work pad from a friend.

I have been on Pop OS 21.10 now as a daily driver for I think a month. Love it. Glad I put it on my 1TB gen 4 m2. That being said, I've finally run into my first two issues I can't seem to resolve:

1. I broke my integrated graphics somehow. I don't know if it was just from an update, but I lost integrated graphics. I have a RTX 3070 Ti, so I clearly have an output. But I was hoping to only have my main monitor on their for gaming purposes. ASUS Prime D wifi z690 motherboard and 12600k processor. The System76 bash commands I used in terminal said my graphics are not switchable. But I've used the integrated graphics before?
2. I tried to install envypn font. [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/envypn-font](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/envypn-font) Seemed like it would be easy enough. Downloaded, extracted and used the bash script to install as well as trying to install each font. The file is in the /font directory. I did fc-cache -rv. It's just like Gnome tweaks or GIMP just don't see it for some reason.

Whether your ignore this or laugh or help out... Thanks. I think I just needed to put this out in the ether.",pop_os,1650743714.0

How? Desktops don't have switchable graphics. You have two GPUs, **each** with its separate output (i.e the cable to the monitor). How did you have it working before?

For fonts, double click from the file manager, and select install. Where is that ```/font``` folder exactly?",pop_os,1650747871.0

eventually you should get a message about upgrading.   Many people wait until a point release comes out..ie:  22.04.1 

which will be in a few months 

Just be sure to upgrade before your release goes EOL and the servers get moved to the 'old-releases' archive servers. (or is that Ubuntu only?) 

You can still upgrade after that move, but it is a bigger annoyance.

So there's no big hurry. But plan on doing it in the future.

5921,post,1,uaaiw1,Is the Pop shop generally laggy and unresponsive?,"I have reasonably modern hardware but whenever I launch pop-shop it is always laggy, often taking more than ten seconds to become responsive. I also feel that it takes more time to install programs through the pop shop than to manually install it through the command line with apt or flatpaks. UI can often become unresponsive too. The loading circle to the right of the search bar often gets stuck and scrolling can drop frames occasionally.

Worst of all, it always says that there are upgrades available even though there aren't and my system is fully upgraded. When I click upgrade it just loads for a few seconds and then says that the system is completely upgraded without actually doing anything. 

In the past I had thought these issues would be ironed out overtime with updates and had removed the Pop shop from my computer with `sudo apt remove pop-shop` and had relied exclusively on the terminal (and the synaptic package manager) to install and upgrade packages. But I decided to give it another go a few days ago and it can still be rather unresponsive.

I noticed that when the problem occurs my settings for desktop backgrounds are resetted !

5941,post,0,ua6jhg,More Touchpad Gestures?,"In the last 2 months I migrated from a windows laptop to a popOS laptop. Almost everything has it's equivalent feature and sometimes a better alternative on the Linux side. But I can't help but point out the glaring lack of more Touchpad Gestures. No double finger swipes to go backward or forward a page, no pinch to zoom, etc.

Is there something I can install that's simple and just works? I've tried looking around but none of the suggestions worked.

Also why aren't these features just included from the beginning? These are so commonplace that I thought popOS would just come with it installed.

Just for your information, I have a 2016 XPS 13. Not sure if that helps in any way.",pop_os,1650723833.0
5942,comment,2,i5z85bu,,"PopOS uses touchegg for the configuration of gestures. 

If you want to install something simple that just works, use [touché](https://github.com/pop-os/touchegg#using-touch%C3%A9), it is available in the pop shop.

However, I prefer [manual configuration](https://github.com/pop-os/touchegg#manual-configuration), and it is honestly quite as simple too.

Either way, you will realise through the touché's gui or the .conf file that it uses dbus commands interacting with pop shell extension for 3 finger swipes, and pop cosmic extension for 4 finger swipes respectively.

I like pop shell for auto tiling and focus on windows through 3 finger swipes, so I leave it as is. I like horizontal workspace and the default application menu, so i disabled pop cosmic and cosmic workspace extensions. With those extensions disabled, my 4 finger swiping gestures wouldn't work as expected. Be sure to backup those dbus commands, or just backup the .conf file instead before you start editing.

With that, I proceeded to edit the actions associated with the gestures. You can reference the [examples](https://github.com/pop-os/touchegg#available-actions) given, and further fine tune it to your liking. You can even add more too.

To be more specific to your question on 2 finger swipes to go backward or forward from a page, pinch to zoom, and etc, you will have to include [specific application configuration](https://github.com/pop-os/touchegg#manual-configuration), `<application name=""Google-chrome,Firefox""></application>`.

You will see that the whole section of the pre existing gestures are enclosed in `<application name=""ALL"">` and `</application>`. Include the specific application section before that and add in your preferred gestures as well. In fact, you can just copy and paste the [pinch to zoom example](https://github.com/pop-os/touchegg#keyboard-shortcut-send_keys). As for forward and backward, edit the modifier to be `Alt_L`, and keys to be `Left` or `Right` respectively instead. You may want to reconsider 2 finger swipes for forwarding and backing a page though.

However, last time I tried them they did only work with the horizontal workspaces that gnome has as default.

Assuming the browser specified by the `application specific setting` is in focus, i'd make an educated guess that it has more to do with distance threshold, where the swipe's distance wasn't long enough for it to recognise as a swipe in a certain direction. 

Key in point, while performing a 3 finger pinch gesture on my touchpad, if I start the gesture with 2 of them too close to each other, it won't work. If i didn't pinch inwards/outwards enough, it won't work. 

I don't think it is a hardware issue, but then again, I'm on thinkpad. It could be, but less likely.

You can? Oh, I never noticed that. And what of the folders in `.local/share` or `.config`, would they be safely removable?

> Pop_OS gnome is a bit more tweaked and polished and enhanced and adjusted than the Ubuntu gnome. You may like it.

I'd be surprised. I like stuff like KDE or the old Windows 7; one fixed taskbar on the bottom of the screen, where you can pin application launchers, and the active windows get grouped under the same icon/pin (XFCE doesn't do this by default, but I use the docklike-plugin).

I hear gnome can be made sort of like that with things like dash-to-dock or something (I forget the name), and I did try that before, but while I don't remember what the problem was clearly, I know it wasn't working well for me (on Ubuntu at least), and I dislike the unfamiliar and clunky-feeling workflow that the default gnome seems to be going for.

> If you don't want to use the Pop_OS DE, then there's not a lot of big reasons to use Pop_OS. It has a few extra features, but the big selling point is the tricked out DE.

In this case, my reason for wanting to switch is ""oh hell no Canonical, stop pushing your stupid snaps; I'm not going to use a browser that updates in the background and doesn't allow me to turn off auto-updates.""

If they hadn't gone ahead and made Firefox in 22.04 a snap, I wouldn't be planning to move from Ubuntu; that's basically my only problem with it (well, and they're clearly moving towards doing it with most other software too, and I dislike it for the same reason). I've updated Firefox manually while running before, and it resulted in crashes and other problems, and I don't want that being forced on me with no way to control or anticipate it, because it's inevitably going to cause loss of some work, or else interruptions at horribly inconvenient times.",pop_os,1650726597.0

As for snaps and Ubuntu, I just go with the flow and tend to stick to the defaults.

No real issues with snaps or flatpaks and I understand the reasoning for them to exist.   I have not tried out 22.04 yet, I will likely wait for 22.04.1

6042,post,1,u9vinz,Radeon R7 340 hybrid graphics suspend issue,"This is maybe more of a general Linux question than Pop!_OS specific, since it's happened with multiple Ubuntu based distros I've tried, but I've settled on Pop!_OS as my distro of choice on my laptop.

I have an HP ProBook 450 G3 that's about 5 years old.  It has hybrid Intel/Radeon graphics, with a Radeon R7/M340 GPU as the discrete GPU.  I cannot get the laptop to suspend and resume reliably without adding `amdgpu.pmrun=0` to the boot parameters.  As I understand it, this is less than desirable because it turns off GPU power management and can result in reduced run time while on battery.  Is there anything else I can try?

`uname -r` gives me `5.16.19-76051619-generic`.

* Keep your system as simple and default as possible. Do you really need every GNOME extension? The more you customize, the more likely you will need to fix something when the upgrade is complete. 

* Organize your filesystem as much as possible so you don't miss anything that you need to back up.

I just really don't get it. Why do they not make sure that dependencies are updated in the repos before doing this crap. libgtk should not break someone system, ever. The fact that the one required for this upgrade isn't in the official repo means you should not be offering the upgrade.

6228,comment,1,i6057y5,,"Hm, maybe. I tried Cinnamon on Fedora in a VM and I like it quite a lot (only ""essential"" thing it's missing is a good sticky-notes app, and my other concerns are all from Fedora itself).

Whereas trying the Cinnamon DE in Pop was rather painful because it seems to be a very out-of-date and absolutely hideous version (I tried Mint years ago; it looked awful and clunky just like the Pop version does now), and also unless I swap back to tty1 and back, logging in with Cinnamon on Pop gives me a black screen (unless I log in as a different user; it's only the *first* one that gives me this problem).

Having not tried it recently though (downloading the ISO now), my concerns about pure Mint (that I can't just test in a VM or live USB) would be:

- Is it as reliable for gaming as Ubuntu? By ""gaming"", I'm talking just Steam pretty much (both native and Proton games). Maybe a silly question since it's based off Ubuntu, but I don't know how many changes they make to it.

- How up-to-date is it in general compared to Ubuntu? I worry it may be slow to update things (both kernel and applications), possibly due to a smaller team/organization behind it and their general dependence on Ubuntu itself (one thing about Pop that sounds nice, other than no snaps, is that they update the kernel way more often, which I hear is good for AMD users like myself).

- Unlike Pop, I've not heard any confirmation they *will* be distributing their own copy of Firefox that avoids snaps?",pop_os,1650810386.0
6229,comment,1,i60e7xr,,"Cinnamon on Fedora was, well, not quite the same as on Mint ;-)  


You can test the UI in a VM. And that's mostly personal preference, my wife likes Cinnamon over Cosmic, my students are on Mint, since they come from Windows and the transition is less drastic for them on Mint, Mac users I usually tell that they should give Pop a try.  


Gaming: no issues with my setup. I don't play heavy A-list games, but everything I tried worked nicely (I use the steam flatpak on both Mint and Pop; Pop has it's own .deb, but I could not see a difference).  
The experience is basically the same with one difference: Mint will ask you in the on-boarding dialogue to install the Nvidia drivers, after that you just go to the Software centre and install Steam.  


Up-to-date: Well Mint is a LTS only distribution, so the next one will be out in June, most likely and based on 22.04. Mint does not have the 6-month release cycle for the base, but has point releases for the DE. For applications, most of that is not an issue, since flatpak integrates nicely into Mint (as it does in Pop).

Kernel: the base/distro kernel is not updated after release, so Mint will stick to the kernel that 22.04 has. However, there will then be (a bit later) the Edge version which has a newer kernel for newer hardware installations. You can always upgrade to the edge kernel at any time. For reference: Mint 20 - based on 20.0LTS - has kernel 5.4, edge is 5.13. But you can also install newer kernels if you want to, I have installed 5.16 on my Mint 20.3 to use a new Bluetooth 5 dongle.

BTW, the ""I hear it's good for AMD users"" is mostly based on support for a new CPU in Pop, when all the others did not support that particular one. Unless you fall into that category, there is usually little point in hunting the last kernel versions. Ubuntu is also pretty good at backporting critical features/firmware and h/w support into their kernels.

Firefox: Mint is snap free, so they will need to distribute their own version of firefox - they had a recent agreement with Mozilla, but I'd need to check the specifics.",pop_os,1650814223.0
6230,comment,2,i60z0ir,,"Just downloaded the Mint ISO and have checked it out in VM...

Only thing I feel unsure of with the setup (in VM) is what to do about software update mirrors; on Xubuntu it automatically seems to have picked a nearby server, but here I have to pick it manually from a list I have no idea how to evaluate the trustworthiness of.

Slightly different appearance to the Fedora Cinnamon for sure, but with a change in theme (Mint-Y-Dark-Aqua) it looks almost the same, which is *gorgeous* by the way.

And the notes! They can be recolored! That makes them better than the xfce notes even!

And unlike Xubuntu, I don't have to use a PPA to get the Windows-like taskbar with pinnable launchers/window groups in the same icon!

Update manager is snazzy as well, and I like the tray icon in the bottom right; does it happen to check for updates automatically and alert me if there are any? Because that would be an amazing improvement over what I have now as well. *EDIT: if the settings for it are to be trusted, yes it does!*

That's a bit annoying... I happen to be waiting on a fix for apparmor that will allow proton games to run inside it, so if it's not updating the kernel without using some probably unstable Edge version I'm probably not likely to get the fix.

Like, I *do* tend to use the LTS anyway on Ubuntu, but through point releases I'm now on kernel 5.13.

Hmm, I dunno... The last time I tried to install a newer kernel on Ubuntu (not as part of an update, just changing the kernel alone), virtualbox (which I need for my work) was broken completely, I assume because there was a mismatch between the version of virtualbox available on Ubuntu at the time, and the newer kernels. Because of that, I'm kind of wary about manually changing kernels.

I don't need VirtualBox specifically, but I also don't really need performance for it either (just running a different OS, and getting a bit more security from being in a VM instead of a host).

At something like line 780 you'll find the definition of `.message .message-close-button {`

*.message .message-close-button {*  
*width: 30px;*  
*height: 30px;*  
*color: white; }*  


the cross icon will still be the same size, but the button will be bigger (you can see the real size by adding `background: black;`)

1. I have the power button on the NUC 12 Extreme set to ""suspend"", but if I hit it, the screen goes off, the fans go to maximum, and ... it will never wake up.  I think it must be having a kernel panic.  Not a big deal, I just won't use the power button.  
2. On my Framework laptop, the fingerprint reader is acting wonky.  I didn't have to compile the fprint library on my own now, but I did have to install it manually.  Registering fingerprints in the Users section of the control panel works fine, but if I lock the screen or try to log in from GDM, it acts like I am repeatedly pressing the wrong finger (by printing authentication failure messages) - even though I am not even touching it.  I had to uninstall fprintd to prevent this from happening.  
3. Again on the Framework, I set the scaling to 175%, but every time I log in, it seems to be reset back to 200%.  
4. I have had a few bluetooth issues when connecting and disconnecting multiple devices.  Rebooting solves this.",pop_os,1650725744.0

1. it kept freezing on or right after the login screen

Booting up with the 21.10 installer from USB, I was able to use the system with the following caveats:

2. The WiFi didn't work

3. The graphics were.. odd (I guess only partially supported)

4. One of the Ethernet ports didn't work

etc.

I think these were all basically because the hardware was too new to be properly supported by the version of the kernel in 21.10.

I'm fairly new to Linux, and I've been absolutely loving Pop OS. Most of the time I forget about the operating system and just get my work done. It's wonderful, and something that windows has never quite figured out. 

I would like to upgrade to Darktable 3.8, because Pop OS has 3.6 repos and there are some features that I want to try. What exactly do I need to do? I need to tell my system to read from a different repo and build a package from there right? I'm on Pop 21.10 by the way.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. You guys rock!

6329,comment,2,i5pck4p,,"Dependency entanglement isn't really a technical term, I was just trying to keep it simple.  Think if it like this, programs you install generally depend on certain libraries to run. One program may rely on libX 2.7, another might rely on libX 3.1, and maybe libX 3.1 doesn't like to be installed on the same system as lib2.7. Maybe other programs that want to use libX 2.7 are now accidentally using libx3.1 because the paths/environment variables got overwritten when you installed libx3.1. There are several ways that it might cause issues. 

Your OS maintainers make sure all the packages in the repo coexist well together. If you add opensuse repos to a pop OS install, everything might be totally fine... or it might not be.   


The flatpak version of an application bundles all its dependencies all in a tidy container. This means that it's not able to share the dependencies with other programs, and instead uses its own private versions of the dependencies. This means the flatpak is probably bigger than if you installed the deb version, but you also won't have to worry about conflicts either.

I think slowly over the next month this OS will be my primary OS windows 11 is a no go for me. I am a new convert!,pop_os,1650550022.0

Just a heads-up, in case this matters, while a vast majority of games DO work on Linux via Steam (check out protondb.com for a pretty good list), there are still a handful that do not.

6389,comment,6,i5nl3xq,,"As a benchmark - I already refused to buy and play games that had restrictive DRM and anti-cheat.

Every single game I own works or can be made to work with GE custom Proton, and Proton can be used to run pretty much anything through Lutris.

In some cases, I lucked out - Batman Arkham Asylum either wasn't running or ran poorly a short time ago. When I tried running it under GE-Proton 7.14, it ran first try and it ran flawlessly. 

So overall gaming is surprisingly good - I thought I'd have to... give something up. Anything. But everything I have works. There's no difference for me running games on Linux vs. running them on Windows outside of some choppiness upon first booting some titles due to shader caches.

Each person's experience will be different - by no means would I expect my experience to be representative. Gaming should only improve from here thanks to Proton and the Steam Deck.",pop_os,1650568720.0

There are some annoying Microsoft things, like the fact that there's no 'reply' button in the chat (I just take a cropped screen-cap of the comment I'm replying to and paste that it - takes like a second on Pop!_OS).

6471,post,9,u8honm,I upgraded from 21.10 to 22.04 LTS via the built-in upgrader today and it worked perfectly.,"I don't advise anybody else to do this just yet until 22.04 is stable and you may even want to wait a little longer if you want to further reduce your chances of breaking your system. 

I couldn't wait to try out the latest 22.04 release and I run Pop! on a Thinkpad that is not critical to my daily life since I have a desktop for that so I figured I'd give it a shot and run ""pop-upgrade release upgrade -f"" a bit early since Ubuntu is about to ship. I have to say one thing though. I don't really customize my Pop! install other than install Flatpaks and a few debs that aren't in the repos. It's a pretty clean installation so I think that's a big reason why I had a positive experience. 

After downloading the packages, the command line told me to reboot and then I got a nice, basic progress bar with the Pop! icon and some basic info that upgraded my Thinkpad in a matter of minutes. I thought it would take longer but it actually went by fairly quickly. 

Things I noticed: 

* flatpak mpv opens faster than before. I always noticed a bit of lag when opening flatpak mpv but this is now acceptably fast to open. Other flatpaks seem to be a little faster to open but mpv was always the slowest to open so this was the most noticeable. 

* the desktop overall feels a bit more responsive. It's definitely an upgrade over 21.10 in that regard.

* the Pop! Shop looks and feels more robust than before. You still have to wait for the circle within a circle to disappear before using it and there's quirks like the list of installed apps is no longer alphabetized, some items are not clearly labeled as flatpaks, and the buttons to open and uninstall the apps seem to be oddly muted in apperance, but overall its an improvement over 21.10 in terms of performance and loading time. 

* The orange accents in the dropdown calendar are gone and replaced with the blue! This was one of my requested UI changes so I'm glad to see it. 

* I expected an icon overhaul with 3.0.0 icon-theme but there's really no change to the icons that I can see. Are they saving that for the Rust DE? I hope so. The current icons are a bit too basic and not in keeping with the nice look of the Pop! Shop icon. Just compare the look of the settings icon next to the Shop icon on your your dock. It's like night and day. Sleek and modern vs. bland, antiquated and dull. Edit: I think only the basic icons should be re-done, not the ones for 3rd party apps. 

Overall, the LTS feels like an optimized 21.10 which is great but another reason to lower your expectations and wait for the stable release. There's not much new to see except the slight changes to the shell picked up from Gnome 42. I don't regret upgrading early one bit.",pop_os,1650524954.0

6523,post,53,u88r0y,Long time linux user but new to POP_OS! - some feedback,"Started to use Linux as my daily OS around 2012, although my first Linux installation was around the year 2000 (mandrake was my first distro), I'm not a dev or anything related with IT. I just can't stand windows and mac right now in my opinion is a decent unix OS, but locked in expensive glorified hardware. So for me, Linux is the right OS.


The most impressive thing about POP_OS! is the pop shell, the tiling windows system plus the traditional desktop metaphor combined together is amazing. I'm really impresses with the work that system76 made on it. I used to use a similar custom desktop half a decade ago but way, way, way clunkier (mate desktop with i3wm as the WM and a custom applet to control it with the mouse)


As for the performance... well it a Linux distro... so it is fast as other distros, although performance wise the fasted OS I used was Solus linux (my previous distro)


What do I miss? well I wish it was a rolling distro instead of a point release one, I mean the core OS seems to be getting a rolling approach now, but as a user, what I really care are the user applications which can be a few month outdated on the repos. If one day pop_os became a rolling distro I hope they take the same approach solus did, what I mean is take time to test the new stuff instead of the arch approach where ppl live on the edge (I had to many broken arch systems due updates)


To conclude if I had to rate POP_OS! I'll give it  9/10. I'm not giving a 10/10 because its not a rolling distro (heh, it's my preference) and because is has a freaking ! exclamation mark in the name. hehe

I've got liquorix kernel to work but it won't upgrade anymore.,"The laptop I am running has some hardware that does not play nice with the generic linux kernel, but works fine with this custom kernel called ""liquorix"". It has some gaming specific tweaks as I understand it, but more importantly it plays nice with my hardware and makes my Linux experience usable. 

Last year when I made the switch to the liquorix kernel, all I had to do was add the kernel's PPA to my sources and install it. Whenever there was a new update for the kernel, it would automatically upgrade my kernel by grabbing the binaries from the PPA and apply the new kernel on the next reboot. 

However, since a few months ago, `sudo apt upgrade` does not upgrade my kernel. It only downloads the vmlinuz and initrd files on to `/boot`. 

In order to apply the kernel, I would need to manually copy the new version's initrd and vmlinuz files from `/boot`  to `/boot/efi/EFI/Pop_OS-gobbledeygook/` and then have to change the paths in a loader.conf file in `/boot/efi/loader` to point to the new files I just copied over, instead of the old, now outdated kernel files. And I need to do this whenever there is an update if I need the latest kernel. Stuff also breaks after a few months if I do not do this process manually. 

This did not use to be the case for me, and it worked perfectly when I did an apt upgrade until one day it decided not to anymore for apparently no reason. What is wrong here? I do not have enough bash programming skills to spin up my own script that can automate this process.",pop_os,1650488766.0

6562,post,5,u7ye9w,"Vulkan support in ""Integrated Graphics"" mode on Nvidia Hybrid laptop?","Anyone notice that Vulkan doesn't seen to work on Nvidia Hybrid laptops when in ""Integrated Graphics"" only mode? I don't think its the GPU since it seems to work using the Intel GPU when in Hybrid mode when running things without specifying the dedicated GPU.

&#x200B;

I tested with Overwatch in Lutris, It works in Nvidia Mode fine, in Hybrid mode without specifying the Nvidia GPU, it will launch with worse performance, listing that it is using the Intel GPU at the top of the settings screen.

But in Integrated Graphics only mode it wont even open.

&#x200B;

Ive also tested with a few steam games, in all 3 graphics modes (Integrated, Hybrid and Nvidia) and native games will open, but Proton ones will seemingly try to start but then appear to fail almost immediately (just changes from ""starting"" to nothing in steam) when in Integrated mode just like they do on an older Intel GPU system that doesn't have Vulkan support.

(Steam itself always runs in Nvidia mode while the system is in Hybrid so this test only shows that it doesn't work in Integrated Mode)

&#x200B;

Anyone know if something isn't loaded that would allow Vulkan to run in Integrated mode in order to maybe save battery? Integrated Graphics only mode has almost entirely been replaced in use by Hybrid since it is essentially Integrated mode with Nvidia GPU on demand, but now im just curious.

&#x200B;

[EDIT]

vulkininfo also seems to have a large 5+ second delay before posting results in Integrated Graphics mode compared to Hybrid, and seemingly fails many tests.

Its an Intel TigerLake-H GT1 using Intel UHD Graphics, so Im assuming it supports Vulkan (and if not it would not of ran Overwatch on the Intel GPU in hybrid mode).",pop_os,1650466588.0

Good, good.

You want to know what is going on just before the system crashes.

Do this once:

`free -h -s 2 -t > ~/free.log &`

This will keep logging until shutdown/crash. Then after reboot run `tail free.log`  to see the last entry before the crash.

Temp readings from sensors without a stress test are rarely useful.

    sensors
    k10temp-pci-00c3

`watch sensors k10temp-pci-00c3`

It seems like the problem that you ran into happens every so often when you update a ""younger"" installation (some applications of your fresh installation still rely on various components that are no longer part of the latest release). I have one installation running for about 18 months and so far updates did go well (with the exception of kernel issues last November).

I think that you have three options right now. You can wait until they fix the issues. Or you install on older version and upgrade your installation afterwards. Or you can try to find out what your fresh installation is missing. This is not a very scientific solution and I do not know if this would really fix your issue. Might be worth a shot though.

I installed budgie, steam, the drivers were pretty fine and dandy and there were no booting problems whatsoever. 

I was very excited when the 21.04 update rolled in because the swipe gestures really hit the spot, as did the launcher. I couldn't get my friends to use it though as they had some freezing issues... It kinda frustrated me because this OS just felt so complete back then with its clean and consistent UI.

Then 21.10 released, I was hoping it would address the issues that made 21.04 not very widely compatible, it just completely broke the OS even for me, the move to gnome 40 was clearly a bad choice since the poor attempts at replicating the gnome 38 workspaces layout made the desktop feel buggy, I couldn't properly switch wallpapers, boot issues, firefox wouldn't launch, steam wouldn't launch on intel drivers, games ran at 40 FPS even though I had a 120hz monitor (yes I ran the games on the nvidia gpu) and it was just... awful.

Yesterday I installed the 22.04 beta to see if there are any improvements over the chaos that were the 2021 versions, It had gotten even worse, rebooting from windows wouldn't allow be to boot back into Pop! All the previously listed issues remained, touch gestures barely even worked.

Why? Where did this OS go so wrong? and why do devs focus on publishing new versions without stabilizing the existing ones? I am aware that 22.04 is still in beta but I won't hold my breath for when it fully releases. If the issues persist on the LTS release it will be pretty hideous.

There are plenty of folks who dual boot without problems, but there are also enough users with dual boot headaches to take note - enough that I would rather run Windows in a VM, if I had no other choice (and I do, so Microsoft can kick rocks).  

Also, before running an OS version upgrade, I'd recommend removing any custom repositories and capturing a disk image before running the full upgrade.  I had some customizations in 21.04 that broke my upgrade to 21.10 and having that image to fall back on let me make some adjustments before the second attempt.  21.10 wasn't the smoothest roll out for quite a few of us, although the engineers have done a great job with the updates since.  My home directory is already backed up to my NAS, so if I do need to do a clean install, I lose nothing important.  I'd recommend the same practices for any distro.

There also was a problem with the Cosmic Dock which seems to have been resolved by now.

So 21.10 was a bit problematic in the early times after release, possibly due to the Gnome version jump.

Re the gaming performance:

* well, having a 120Hz (monitors are measured in Hz, not fps) monitor does not mean a thing if your card is too slow. So that's not really an argument. The monitor will still run at 120Hz, but if the GPU can only render 40fps, then that's what you get (3 times the same frame, basically).
* are you running the games in Nvidia only mode? Or are you in hybrid mode? If you are in hybrid mode (and your description sounds like it), you'll have another bottleneck because the graphics are rendered on the GPU, but then passed to the integrated graphics card to display. Hybrid mode slows my Nvidia GPU down by about 50%. So it's not meant for gaming, but for OpenGL workflows (CAD, Blender, etc.) that optimise for battery runtime, rather than performance.",pop_os,1650445446.0

Turns out Cosmic Dock(preinstalled in pop\_os) is a fork of a Dash to Dock([https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/)) and we can change pressure by accessing the same parameter as in dash to dock:

    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock pressure-threshold VALUE_OF_CHOICE

As you can see, they just point to EFI partitions on GPT disks, and multiple distros and operating system can utilize the same EFI partition. They do **NOT** need their own unique partitions. You *may* have artificial limitiations along the way, like PopOS installer requires a 500mb EFI partition, but you can recreate the EFI, and/or create a secondary to replace and recover the space for the previous, should you want to (personally, I don't).

I might just end up pointing you in the right direction rather than holding your hand though ;) so don't expect TOO much. I'm hoping the video will be my response in the future :P

Be aware that it may cause problems, specially when upgrading to a newer version of the OS. I use kisak's PPA for newer MESA drivers (stock one breaks VAAPI support for old GPUs), but I have to purge it when I upgrade as explained in the PPA website.

You can also look at Radeon Profile, it may do what you want:

I can hear the click but it has no effect on the link that I clicked on, requiring me to click a second time. It happens with the LMB and with the scroll wheel (ie. pressing the scroll wheel).

As noted it's random but happens often enough to be annoying, perhaps as often as every 10th click.

I've also noticed that selecting a new text box (on a web page) for input can appear to require multiple mouse clicks before the cursor appears there. It's as if the polling is turned way down, except that it's not consistent.

I notice it in both Firefox and Vivaldi so I don't think it's a browser specific issue. I don't notice it while in other apps or on the desktop.

The multi desktop scrolling it just the stupidest thing I've ever seen. Like, they were all there on the right side, ready to go, no scrolling, easily see all desktops, and BAM, now I gotta scroll like an idiot through multiple desktops to find the one I wanted, just so it can look more like a mac peasant..

To be fair, this is exactly how I felt about GNOME 3 after a life of GNOME 2. So I'll probably come around in due time, I'm just not ready for this kind of commitment and I need to make sure there's a safe roll back to GNOME 3 before upgrading.

EDIT:

So many downvotes because I don't like the visual changes.. toxic linux community is toxic.

To sum this up, Pop!\_OS 20.04 uses Gnome 3, and when you snap the mouse to the top left, it opens the activities thing. The dock is directly below the mouse on the left side for quick access, all windows in the middle, and desktops on the left. It utilizes the entire screen and is just pleasing. I've been using this layout for years and now everything is changing, so muscle memory makes this like trying to learn a whole new computer.

Cosmic also changes this, you snap to the top left, and now the desktops are on the left where the dock used to be, the dock is now at the bottom like a mac, and windows in the middle, with this unsettling empty void on the left.

Now with Gnome 4x, you snap to the top left, dock is at the bottom, nothing on the sides, and the desktops are blown up in the middle and you have to scroll through them all to see the windows for each one which makes switching desktops a much longer task than it used to be. There is the tiny little preview at the top when you have more than one open, but compared to how it was, I could actually see what windows were on which desktop with the old layout when they were on the sides. Now it's just inconvenient for my use case.

I don't care what base version of GNOME is running, I just want the old layout, and GNOME 3 has it like that right out of the box. If I can just run that, then I don't have extra steps. It makes it simple and I can just use it to get work done and not have to learn a completely new UI with everything moved.

But apparently liking things the way they use to be offends people. Didn't realize this was such a sensitive subject..",pop_os,1650331761.0

Like this new UI change is just something I'm not ready for, I'm trying to figure out how to reserve the old layout for as long as I can before diving into the change and people respect that decision as I would for anyone else. Flawless community in that part. And then it just ends up being all about how Cosmic and Gnome 4x being better instead of actually having input to a solution. That's the issue I was expressing, but I'll admit, not as clearly as it could have been.

I just see it a lot on multiple Linux sub reddits, and now asking for help with Linux ends up being a walk on egg shells, so I only end up posting if I literally can't not figure it out after hours of searching.

As for extensions, I'm playing with Manjaro because I know nothing about Arch and that's the current learning direction right now, which is why this Pop!\_OS UI change is really throwing me off when I'm fully invested in testing the waters with Arch, I don't need more learning curves thrown at me from ol' faithful lol. But that being said. Manjaro 21 also uses Gnome 42, and I just found an extension called Vertical Overview which basically solves this entire issue. However, on Manjaro, there's a layout switcher to pick the legacy mode (Gnome 3.38 style), but the workspaces still uses the new Gnome 40+ layout. So, if I can get it working on Pop!\_OS 22.04 (possibly needing to use the layout switcher if there's a version for Debian), then I think this actually resolves the issue entirely while being able to use the latest updates, without the latest UI.",pop_os,1650418903.0

Because the way extensions work in gnome-shell each extension is just overriding functions in gnome-shell at run time. If two extensions try to re-write the same gnome-shell extension it will cause a conflict. Which is what happens here with cosmic-workspaces and any dock/dash extension.
So then by the time cosmic-workspaces loads it is expecting code that is never loaded, thus the picker is allocated a negative height. Which is then displayed as a dot on the screen.

For the upcoming 22.04 release we updated our cosmic-dock extension to use the latest upstream version of ubuntu dock (which is what almost all dash to dock extensions are based on), and we ran into this bug as well.

   * Tried generic ISO with exact same result
* System has other Linux installs
   * Tried the Grub CLI suggestion from another post but my issue is not the live usb unable to boot

I can open Disks app and see all my drives and partitions.... so now wondering if there are some switches I can pass via command line to the startup app or something?

Is there a anyway to bypass the installer, was trying to search for some manual directions?

So I discovered in my case, I had (keep) two other USB devices, a webcam and headset plugged in which appears to cause the io.elementary.installer app to have issues. Making sure I had no other USB connections solved my issue with the installer ;-)

6889,post,5,u6kbuk,Need Help With Some Issues,"I just started using linux 3 days ago, and after trying out Ubuntu, Zorin, and PopOS, I have settled on PopOS. I have encountered some issues and would like to have your advice.

1. I was able to set up fingerprint for login on PopOS 20.04. Upgrading to 21.10, the option was simply gone from the settings. Is there a fix for this?
2. I would like to have Veracrypt run on startup, minimised to tray icon, but I am not quite sure how to go about doing this. I have tried adding an entry in ""Startup Applications"" with the command `/usr/bin/veracrypt`(that I copied from the output of `sudo which veracrypt`). The result is a bugged GUI of veracrypt upon startup, and obviously not minimised. What other commands should I put beside the binary in ""Startup Applications"", or is there another way?
3. Bitwarden noticeably starts slower when installed through **.flatpak** as compared to **.deb**. However, on Bitwarden's download page where I obtained the .deb package, it says that there is no auto-upgrade. Checking for updates through Bitwarden's GUI opens up a link to github's release page. Per my limited understanding so far, this means that I went with the manual installation route, and though similar to chrome's .deb installation, chrome's package included a script to pull their repository (?). Is there a way to pull that ""info"" so that when I run `sudo apt update`, it is able to pull the update for me to upgrade? Am I on the right track or is this simply not the best practice? If somehow there is no other way, is upgrading the app as simple as running .deb again?


4. I would like to disable trackpad acceleration. Previously on Ubuntu, I tried the following [fix](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1030086/how-do-i-turn-off-touchpad-acceleration), and while it worked, it disabled triple finger touch. I figured if I applied that fix on PopOS, it will go as far as disabling the current multi-gestures implementation, and that will be undesirable. Is there a better way to disable trackpad acceleration without affecting other features, hopefully less of a 'one step forward and two steps back' approach?
5. Is there a way to eliminate screen tearing with fractional scaling @ 125%? Ultimately, the consensus I get from the net is to go with Wayland (I don't even know what this is yet), but the downside is that there are incompatibility with applications.

Thanks in advance.

4. You can use `xinput` to set the libinput acceleration profile to 'flat' like this: `xinput --set-prop 'PIXA3854:00 093A:0274 Touchpad' 'libinput Accel Profile Enabled' 0 1`. Note that I found my touchpad device name via just typing 'xinput' which shows a list of devices. So you would replace `PIXA3854:00 093A:0274 Touchpad` with whatever xinput reports your touchpad device name is.

To re-enable acceleration for trackpad: `xinput --set-prop 'PIXA3854:00 093A:0274 Touchpad' 'libinput Accel Profile Enabled' 1 0`",pop_os,1650338721.0

6909,comment,11,i5abqkc,,"First, to attempt an answer at your question:

In the broadest sense, simply connecting these accounts to your computer won’t necessarily have a big impact on privacy. Although signing in to services on the computer and linking that a browser does mean Google or Microsoft will get to observe and track pretty much everything of importance that you do on the device.

The impact to your privacy is more affected simply by having these services in the first place. The data mining that they do will be present just by using their services and, say, letting Gmail read and index all of your emails, docs, and calendar items. This is the potential for loss of privacy.

A better way to integrate services while preserving privacy would be to switch to privacy-respecting competitors.

Email - ProtonMail or Tutanota
File storage - Nextcloud, Tresorit ($$), or NordLocker
Photo storage and document editor - Cryptee

For storage you could instead go with cloud storage providers like Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud and use a vaulting software like Cryptomater.",pop_os,1650332436.0

1. Inconsistent Bluetooth microphone stability - I'm using Microsoft Teams with the browser version and the Linux application from the pop store. When I joined a meeting, It is about a 50-50 chance If the mic is going to work. I have look in the gnome sound settings and it looks like it is set to my default audio input but Even within the settings menu, it does not register any sound coming in. This is huge. Issue for me because I am in meetings all day and It is a pain in the butt. To switch back between my phone and my laptop. 
2. Dell Thunderbolt dock crashes gnome - I have two external displays in addition to my laptop and I use a dock too have one simple connection to attach them. After about an hour or more of using gnome seems to crash; monitors go blank, and my gnome session seems to reboot. This is super annoying, especially when I am in the middle of doing something. I consider myself an intermediate Linux user, but I struggle with understanding where some of the system logs would be if I were on windows, I would look at the event log to see what crashed.

7019,post,1,u656uz,What Version Of Cinnamon Should I Install To Pop OS?,"As I understand it, there's:
cinnamon
cinnamon-core
cinnamon-desktop-environment

This post https://askubuntu.com/questions/799751/whats-the-difference-between-the-apt-packages-cinnamon-and-cinnamon-desktop sates that just cinnamon would get you the desktop without certain features. What features would be missing? It doesn't mention any specifics about cinnamon-core so what would be different about cinnamon-core? It says cinnamon-desktop-environment would get you the full desktop environment, but what does all of that entail exactly?

What I'm aiming for is Pop OS as a base because they handle Nvidia graphics out of the box but I want to use Cinnamon Desktop Environment because I strongly prefer it to any other desktop environment. I want the ability to retain Cinnamon Desktop applets, extensions, package repair tool, kernal management tool and so on, for example.

But if I'm not mistsken, installing cinnamon-desktop-environment is essentially like installing Linux Mint itself.. I want Pop OS to handle all the graphics as Linux Mint just simply still has issue with Nvidia graphics out of the box, so I'm worried that having it installed will lead to having to do workarounds at some point. So if I set Cinnamon as the desktop and shutdown then power on, will Cinnamon get in the way of the system properly booting? So I guess the larger question is, does Cinnamon directly affect graphics handling or is that something directly handled by Linux Mint itself?

So, in summary does anyone have any experience at all with running the Cinnamon desktop on Pop OS?",pop_os,1650258061.0

you don't really downgrade  a Ubuntu install, and you don't convert a Ubuntu install to pop_os.  You are getting a lot of terms mixed up.

7322,post,3,u5ao31,Input Lag while typing,"Hello!

So I've tried a few Linux distros and settled for Pop! Os because I really enjoy the aesthetic and features.

However, as soon as I start typing something on the OS my CPU spikes to 100% and I have to wait until the letters appear that I typed. I attached some screenshots from the Resource Manager where you can see that in idle it runs smooth, but as soon as I press a key it shoots up to 100%.

I have this problem with other Distros too, so I am at a loss what could cause this.

I've updated the system and everything, but I just don't know what could cause this.

I am running the following Hardware:

* CPU: Intel Core i7-10700
* GPU: NVIDIA 1050 TI
* 1GB SSD
* USB Keyboard

I am looking for advice on how to fix this issue because I want to switch to Linux. Do you think it is related to the Graphics Driver or in general some faulty drivers? Kernel problem?

Would be very grateful if somebody could help me troubleshoot this problem.#

&#x200B;

EDIT: Okay, so it seems like my **CPU Usage spikes to 100%** as soon **as I start typing**. After that, it flattens out again. Here is a Screenshot of my Resources, where you can see the spikes that happen when I started typing.

[https://i.imgur.com/exA9Dit.png](https://i.imgur.com/exA9Dit.png)

EDIT2: I just spammed a Key and it seems like the whole system is ""lagging"" when I do that. Resources are looking like that: [https://i.imgur.com/s9sbdYO.png](https://i.imgur.com/s9sbdYO.png)

The flatline is when I just click around the system and surf the web, as soon as I press a Key it spikes to 100% and freezes.

**EDIT3**: **It seems to be fixed. Thanks to the user** /u/canadaduane ! 

Every time I typed something my ""gnome-shell"" went up to 100% and my system froze.

There seems to be a bug related to a mismatch of Keyboard Layouts. It gets talked about here [https://askubuntu.com/questions/1025302/media-keys-delayed-and-cause-a-cpu-spike-to-100-on-ubuntu-17-10-with-gnome](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1025302/media-keys-delayed-and-cause-a-cpu-spike-to-100-on-ubuntu-17-10-with-gnome)

I just changed everything to the ""default"" Language (English Keyboard Layout, en-US) and the error went away. I have no clue why that is, but I am happy that it worked for me.

Thank you all for the help!

I had xanmod kernel installed on my PopOS. I tried to install wireguard and it automatically installed 5.11 kernel and now my system is booting 5.11 kernel. 

kernelstub -p shows Kernel path as xanmod 5.14 but after booting uname -r shows 5.11-generic. 

How can I revert back to xanmod? I am sure nothing in my system is broke, but am not getting how to change to xanmod kernel.

EDIT - I managed to solve the issue. I followed this [tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/comments/guej8v/tutorial_switchchangeswap_kernels/) to check my default kernel and change it to xanmod. Although since I was using Refind boot manager, Xanmod kernels boot entry was missing and only generic kernel's was shown. I thought that xanmod kernel was disabled and hence not showing. Issue was with Refind. After I hide/unhide a few entries, Xanmod was also shown. Maybe refind refreshed the entries at that time. Hope this helps someone later :)",pop_os,1650108715.0

7521,comment,2,i58it4n,,"THAT FIXED IT. THANK YOU KINDLY, SIR! 

I did exactly what you said. Upon launch, the app went full screen as usual. After clicking 'Toggle Full Screen', nothing actually happened—it stayed full screen. Worth noting: I think other people see a subtle visual cue that it becomes *windowed* full-screen. However, I don't see this. After clicking 'Toggle Full Screen', the window doesn't flinch at all. Anyway, after clicking the double-arrows icon, as mentioned, the window immediately jumps back into a regular sized window. Resizable and all. 

This is clearly a bug with the 'Toggle Full Screen' mode + double-arrows icon. I can replicate the issue by clicking 'Toggle Full Screen' again. What happens is it jumps into full screen, and the double-arrows icon becomes useless again. It just highlights/unhighlights whenever I click it, without doing anything. What's further unhelpful, is that the 'Toggle Full Screen' menu link *never* shows a checkmark to signifiy being active or not. So at this point the full screen seems broken, until I click the toggle button & double-arrows icon in succession.

7555,comment,3,i4u8r5q,,"My best guess as to why you're two hosts produce different results using the same test procedure is a difference in data bus capabilities. My HP Z840 desktop has USB 3.0 (5Gbps) ports, but none of them exceed 400MB/s throughput and that bandwidth is likely shared amongst all 7+ ports. My System76 laptop has USB 3.2 rev 2 (10Gbps) and actually pushes 1GB/s throughput. So my disk benchmarks of SSDs typically differ.

You may also have differing bottlenecks in your storage destination, but that shouldn't affect the Disks benchmark.

As to why your actual throughput in Nautilus differs from Disks benchmarking: they're different operations and you should expect different results. Disks benchmark is reading a sequential block read while Nautilus is reading through a filesystem where the underlying blocks are likely not sequential. If you're copying a single large file (like a large video) you may approach the same result as Disks benchmark.",pop_os,1650035242.0

I've had the same problem trying to install only Office, that happened due to network instabilities during the instalation, and it persisted even after bc of the downloaded files.

In my case I solved it via terminal, using $ flatpak uninstall --unused

But while researching for an answer I found out some people used different solutions, so an ""universal"" solution for this would be:

~ flatpak repair

~ flatpak repair - - user

~ flatpak uninstall - - unused

~ flatpak update - -appstream

And than install the flatpak using a stable connection. 

I'm not sure but I think any flatpak could be susceptible to errors like that, but since Only Office is relatively big(near 500mb) the download takes more time making it riskier. 

Also my wifi became very uninstable since the last kernel uptade, so I needed to use an Ethernet cable to properly install the only office flatpak version.",pop_os,1649977109.0

partition 2- windows reserved

7708,comment,2,i4ot6ra,,"* Boot to Pop USB
* Shrink your partitions to make some space using gparted (backups required)
* Format new space to NTFS (this is important)
* Boot to Windows
* Install to new NTFS partition

You can use ventoy to create a Pop and Win USB (both in one).
If you install to an already created NTFS partition (rather than some free space) Windows won't create the small extra partitions, which makes reallocating space later easier. Windows will put its EFI files in a new folder in your ```/boot/efi``` partition, named ```microsoft``` and will create a new boot entry in your bios. Done.

Extra bonus, Pop will pickup that folder after the first boot to Pop and you will have a nice Windows entry in your Pop (systemd-boot) menu to select OS.",pop_os,1649936894.0

I'm guessing it conflicted with some new config imposed by the update. Removing this config and refreshing the font cache fixed it. I'm very lucky I wrote that down!

7816,comment,3,i4nqofk,,"Completely depends. Sometimes, if not many people are affected and/or it's harder to reproduce, it can take ages. 
You can find 5+ year old bugs on some mailing lists. 
Then there's the phenomenon that devs like to fix the ""low hanging fruit"" kind of bugs first, too. 

Only if a large number of people are affected in a very bad way, stuff moves quickly. Define quickly as 1-2 weeks. 
But then, since most of those changes happen upstream, it takes more time until patches arrive in your chosen distro. 

Imo that is what established closed source OSs do better. Imagine millions of Mac users couldn't connect to their wifi suddenly. The forums and the internet would explode and media would report about it, and you bet, that in 1-2 days there'd be a patch out. Something like that happened when the iphone 6 back in '14 couldn't make calls anymore. Took two days to roll a fix out globally to millions of devices.

Honestly I think that kernel development gets more effd up every day. For those ones being scared by fixing these things .. or waking up one day to stuff not working being unable to work/be productive, it's probably better to stick to a distro that's more conservative regarding kernel and drivers.

In Manjaro there was an option to disable that, but I haven't found a way to disable PSR in Pop!OS and I did not find much for Ubuntu either.

PSR is an option of the Intel HD Graphics as far as I know, but I am too bad to figure this out by myself, and I have tried the last week whenever I found time.

I also found that when I am not interrupting the system with mouse or keyboard inputs, the refreshrate is just fine. I think something is getting confused.

This appeard on a fresh install of the OS, nothing done yet. Pop!\_OS 21.10, Gnome 40.4, X11

After a BIOS update recently, the computer cannot show the grub menu I originally used. Instead, after starting, it shows a whole black command-line interface of grub. And after I type exit, it boots into Windows. I also tried to boot into linux but unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to do it with commands.

Since I'd encountered many issues when I installed Linux due to the A+N structure of my computer, I followed this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbzCSjlbInY) to fix the grub menu. It may help to clarify my grub booting structure since I followed the steps totally.

I was recently prompted to update to Windows 11. My laptop already was a clunker with 10, now it’s nearly unusable with the windows side.
So I want to wipe that entirely and just boot with PopOS (already installed- dual booting).
The catch is, I’d like to recover files from my windows OS (photos, docs, etc) before I do this. I’m getting a “your PC couldn’t start properly” blue screen when I attempt to load windows, and recovery/repair options offered in the Pc itself have failed to solve it. So I’d like some tips on how to:

1. Access and move the files I want from Windows (with or without having to actually boot into it - not sure what that may look like)
2. Do a full install of PopOS (wiping windows) without losing any of the customization I’ve done to the PopOS instance that is already on my laptop. And keeping any files that have been in PopOS. (I.e., just getting rid of windows and I guess, repartitioning everything so it’s as though PopOS is the manufactured OS for my laptop)

Some applications refuse to open in Cinnamon but work fine in the default COSMIC environment. My theory is that it's due to my version of Cinnamon being outdated.

They are not 'bad' but they can be problematic if they are not done right. 

Typically a release upgrade will disable any 3rd party PPA's


>>>    do you really NEED the latest?

> Some applications refuse to open in Cinnamon but work fine in the default COSMIC environment. My theory is that it's due to my version of Cinnamon being outdated.

I doubt if that is the case. It can depend on the program, but a Application should be able to run on almost any DE.  You can even run X gui programs with no DE.

as a test, run the program from a terminal, and watch the terminal for error messages.  Without details about the exact program its hard to tell what may be the issue.

There are some DE specific programs.  But in general most programs should work on any DE.

If the user compiles stuff and keeps it all in their home, they should not be affecting the stability of the system.  

Of course not all things can be compiled/installed in a way they stay constrained to the users home. It is an opportunity to learn  a skill that will be useful in the future. A full DE may fall in to the 'not easy to keep in home' category.

I have been using Pop_OS! as my main operating system about a year now and I really like the project.

The only thing that I have been getting some trouble is regarding some gaming utilities that I have to compile by myself to get the latest updates, like MangoHud and GOverlay, for example. Gamescope, that is a great utility, is really difficult to compile on Ubuntu derivatives, due to the lack of updated dependencies.

As Pop_OS! team already packages the latest updates for Lutris, packaging other gaming utilities (MangoHud, GOverlay, Gamescope and VKBasalt, for example) would make the OS more appealing for a gaming audience. 

Could you package those gaming utilities?",pop_os,1649733426.0

**Fixing nvidia dkm**

      Check that your locate is working before starting.
    dkms status
    apt list --installed '*dkms*'
    sudo purge 'nvidia-dkms-*'
    sudo apt autoremove
    sudo updatedb
    locate *dkms*nvidia*.ko  # under /var/lib/dkms/nvidia
     rm any old .ko files or old trees
    sudo updatedb
     one more check for old files
    
    sudo apt install --mark-auto nvidia-dkms-[version]

      nvidia, 510.54, 5.16.15-76051615-generic, x86_64: installed
    
     Installing the driver to the backup kernel
    sudo dkms install -m nvidia/510.54 -k 5.16.11-76051611-generic

**Fixing nvidia without refreshing the system.**

     Run system backup of / /boot /boot/efi
     Check that your locate is working before starting.
    
    sudo apt purge '*nvidia*'  # you can add --dry-run
    sudo apt autoremove

I installed on an old Macbook Pro and noticed that the battery has been dying overnight.

I noticed that immediately after suspending, it would wake back up and show the lock screen. I checked logs in `/var/log/syslog` and noticed some of the follow log snippets:

    PM: suspend entry (deep)

    ACPI: PM: Preparing to enter system sleep state S3
    ACPI: EC: event blocked
    ACPI: EC: EC stopped

Followed by the following within the same second:

    ...
    ACPI: PM: Waking up from system sleep state S3
    ACPI: EC: interrupt unblocked

8051,comment,1,i4c6kpe,,"Maybe a device is causing the wakeup, had a similar issue on my desktop but didn't have these error messages. You can try to disable acpi wakeup devices.

List all devices that can wakeup your system

```
cat /proc/acpi/wakeup
```

You can disable a device with
```
echo *device name* > /proc/acpi/wakeup

E.g. echo USB1 > /proc/acpi/wakeup
```
List the devices again and you should see the status as disabled.

Then put your system into suspend to test.

You can start with USB devices, I ended up having to go down the list until I found the culprit.

Also check to see if you are able to wake the system with keyboard/mouse/power button. Probably don't want to disable those!

This won't persist between shutdowns and you have to make the change permanent. Use a systemd service file for that,
